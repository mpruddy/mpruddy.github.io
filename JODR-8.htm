		<p class="MsoNormal" align="center" style="text-align:center">&nbsp;</p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><font size="4">The 
		Fenians of America had made up their minds It would be well to hold a 
		grand Irish fair in Chicago, hi the Spring of MIL and requisition had 
		been made upon the organization in Ireland to send on anything that 
		could be collected in tile shape of old Irish relies, books, pictures, 
		etc. Henry O'Clarence McCarthy came to Ireland as a commissioner from 
		the projectors of the fair, and also as a commissioner from John 
		O'Mahony to examine and report upon the condition of the Irish 
		Revolutionary Organization in Ireland, England and Scotland. The <i>
		Irish People</i> office was made the depot for the shipping of any 
		articles collected for the fair, and every day there came to us parcels 
		of rare books, pictures and swords, guns, croppy pikes And other 
		articles of old Ireland's manufactures and produce. These were carefully 
		packed and taken to the United States by Mr. McCarthy.</font></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><font size="4">During 
		the time Mr. McCarthy was in Ireland he did his best to acquire a 
		knowledge of the strength of the organization. To give him assistance in 
		that matter I was instructed to visit Liverpool, Manchester and other 
		parts of England with him. It was on this tour I met for the first time 
		the Rev. David Bell (now in New York), at a hotel in Manchester. I was 
		not personally acquainted with Bell before, but I knew him well by 
		reputation. He was a prominent actor in the Tenant League agitation of 
		1852 and '53, he was then an Episcopal or Presbyterian clergyman in the 
		north of Ireland. O'Reilly, the hotel keeper in Manchester, introduced 
		me to him; we got talking, and before the talking ended he signified his 
		willingness to join heart and hand in the movement we were organizing to 
		make Ireland free and independent of England. Here in Manchester I will 
		leave him for the present, but he will come my way by and by again.&nbsp;&nbsp;
		</font></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><font size="4">When 
		Henry O'Clarence McCarthy and myself were in Liverpool, George 
		Archdeacon, who died in New York some years ago, came to our hotel one 
		morning, bringing me a telegram from James Stephens asking me to be in 
		Dublin that night. There was just time to catch the train which would 
		enable me to make Dublin in the evening, and off for Dublin Mr. McCarthy 
		and myself started. We reached there about 7 o'clock. I saw James 
		Stephens. He told me the business I was wanted for was to attend a 
		public meeting that was to be held at the Rotunda at 8 o'clock that 
		evening. I was told the part I had to take at that meeting. He asked me 
		did I think I would be man enough for it? I told him I would try — would 
		do my best, anyway. He smiled, gave me a few platform tickets and we 
		parted. I went to a barber's shop, got shaved, changed my traveling 
		clothes, got to the Rotunda platform in good time, looking some one and 
		twenty years younger than I look to-day. Looking at the Irishmen who 
		were at that Rotunda meeting that night, and looking at them to-day, it 
		makes me feel as if I was going through a graveyard reading on the 
		tombstones the names of a generation of brave men past and gone. Icily 
		cold falls on my ears the cry of the sham patriots of Ireland who tell 
		us to “bide our time” and “wait for the opportunity,” when I see dying 
		out, year after year, the men who in early life would shed their hearts' 
		blood for the cause, or for any good cause at all.</font></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><font size="4">This 
		meeting at the Rotunda that I am now to speak of came about this way: 
		The peaceable, constitutional and parliamentary agitators of that time 
		were just the same as the peaceable, constitutional and parliamentary 
		agitators of the present time; they were as good men and their 
		principles were as good. All the Irishmen of that time respected John 
		Martin, the '48 rebel, as much as all the Irishmen of the present day 
		respect Charles Stewart Parnell. But Irishmen of my class respect 
		principles more than men. John Martin got in among the agitators 
		twenty-one years ago, and he with them had to fly from that Rotunda 
		meeting before the meeting was ended.</font></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><font size="4">The 
		English flunkey element of Dublin were going to erect a monument in 
		College Green to Queen Victoria's husband, who had died a short time 
		before that, and the Irish Parliamentary party wrote and spoke 
		protestingly against such a thing being done. The Dublin corporation 
		voted a site in College Green for the statue, and the parliamentary 
		patriots called an indignation meeting to scold the whole scheme out of 
		existence. It may seem strange that the Fenians should set their face 
		against such a meeting as that, but they did it, and the reason of their 
		doing it was this: They did not want to see the moral force agitators 
		acquire the popularity of patriots, by protesting against the erection 
		of a Prince Albert statue in College Green—which popularity they would 
		surely use to crush the revolutionary movement that would hurl into the 
		Liffey or into the sea every monument of English domination that raised 
		its head in the land. James Stephens called around him the centers of 
		Dublin and stated the case to them. He considered it wise there and then 
		to put a stop to the game the agitating patriots were playing. The 
		centers concurred in his wisdom and decided to marshal their men at the 
		Rotunda on the night of the meeting.</font></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><font size="4">Alexander 
		M. Sullivan, who died last year, was editor of the <i>Nation</i> 
		newspaper. He was the active man in getting up the meeting. He was most 
		obnoxious to the Fenians on account of his actions regarding them in the 
		past and him particularly it was decided to pay off at that mooting. I 
		had come into newspaper controversy with him on a few occasions, and it 
		was considered well to have me at that Rotunda meeting to confront him. 
		That is why I was telegraphed for to England. There was to be no 
		unfriendly interference with the meeting if Mr. Sullivan was not made a 
		prominent figure in it; but if he was made a prominent figure I was to 
		propose that he be expelled that meeting, and the men in the body of the 
		hall were to make way for him to pass out. If he did not go quietly 
		through the channel that was made for him, a few men were to take hold 
		of him and escort him out.</font></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><font size="4">The chair 
		was taken and the speechmaking commenced. The O’Donoghue of the Glens — 
		the Parnell of that day —commenced his speech. He spoke standing upon a 
		large table that was on the platform; he alluded to his &quot;esteemed 
		friend, A. M. Sullivan,&quot; and no sooner were the words out of his mouth 
		than the uproar commenced. The chairman called for order, but no order 
		would come. I wished to have O'Donoghue heard, and I went upon the table 
		alongside of the O'Donoghue and asked the people to listen to him; the 
		table would not stand It; the legs of it gave way; there was a crush; I 
		fell into the arms of the people who were in front of the platform. I 
		don't know how the O'Donoghue fell. I was put back upon the stage, and 
		when I looked around I saw the whole crowd of the O'Donoghue people and 
		Sullivan people skedaddling through the back doors. In five minutes' 
		time from the crash of the table there was not a man on that platform 
		but Fenians, and there they were going on with all kinds of fun. One man 
		held aloft on a cross leg of the table the green baize cloth that had 
		covered the table, singing &quot;Up for the Green;&quot; another held aloft 
		another cross leg, proclaiming himself a missoner who was leading a 
		crusade against the infidels. The Dublin papers next morning said it was 
		the most good humored mob Dublin over witnessed, but that its 
		organization was dangerous to the government, as it bespoke discipline 
		and determination to be successful in its purpose.</font></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><font size="4">The moral 
		force patriots were very much annoyed that their meeting was broken up 
		by tile Fenians; they announced they would hold another meeting that day 
		week; that they would hold it In the middle of the tiny instead of at 
		night, and that admission was to be had only by tickets, which tickets 
		were to be got at the <i>Nation</i> office. A volunteer guard was called 
		for who were to have charge of the doors and be prepared to repel the 
		advance into the building of any Fenian suspects. The day of meeting 
		came, and I had plenty of tickets of admission. I got seine from Dr. 
		Edward Power, who was subsequently a convict with me, and who died in 
		Oxford, N. J., two years ago. I got more from Eugene Nolan, of Carlow, 
		who was a medical student at the Catholic university, a brave dashing 
		Irishman, dead also. In fact our friends had as many tickets as they 
		desired, because in Dublin that time there was hardly an Irishman of any 
		spirit who was not a member or a sympathizer of our organization.</font></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><font size="4">I 
		presented myself at one of the doors of the Rotunda the day of the 
		meeting. I showed my ticket to one usher; it was good and he passed me 
		in; but the usher inside of him recognized me and cried: &quot;Hold!&quot; I was 
		recognized and was told I could not pass in. I remonstrated, but it was 
		no use. I asked to have my ticket back, but could not get it; police 
		were around me, and I knew they were there at the requisition of the 
		projectors of the meeting, and would have me taken to the lockup If I 
		gave the least excuse for arrest. One of the police told me it was 
		better for me go away, and as he said that, one of the ushers named 
		Joseph Hanley caught me by the beard and shoved me back. &quot;Ah, you're a 
		mean coward,&quot; was all I could say or do; the police had me shoved aside 
		in a moment. I don't let myself got vexed often, but I was vexed that 
		day —vexed to think that fellow should, under the protection of the 
		police, catch me as he did; but there was no help for it unless I wanted 
		to got myself taken to jail, and then my friends even would say I lost 
		my head and lost my wits in the battle. I learned from one of our men 
		that James Stephens was in a house convenient watching the proceedings. 
		I went to the house and met him. &quot;Captain,&quot; said I, &quot;you see those lower 
		windows of the Rotunda, we can scale those windows and go in; what do 
		you say?&quot; &quot;I order you to go right straight to the office in Parliament 
		street and stay there till I meet you.&quot; I had to obey orders. I went to 
		the office; the captain and others turned up by and by and talked and 
		laughed over the adventures of the day. The most ridiculous feature in 
		the attitude of the agitators was that here were they meeting to protest 
		against the erection of a monument to Queen Victoria's husband in 
		Ireland and they wore obliged to apply to Queen Victoria's deputy in 
		Ireland to protect them while holding the meeting. They had made special 
		application for an extra police force at the Rotunda that second day of 
		meeting and the extra force was there. But it was evident the agitators 
		were crushed and the backbone of moral force agitation was broken in 
		Ireland. Those meetings at the Rotunda showed the strength of the 
		organization, and also showed the agents of England in Ireland that they 
		had to be on their guard. The English know that Ireland has always in it 
		the food for rebellion, and they use every art of church and State to 
		destroy it. To send the Irish out of Ireland has always been England's 
		grand panacea for the pacification of Ireland. It is her panacea to-day; 
		it was her panacea last year when she was paying the passage from 
		Ireland to America of even the unarmed or armless people whom the 
		operation of her Landlord laws had driven into the poorhouses of 
		Ireland. &quot;To hell or to Connaught with them&quot; was the cry in days of old; 
		to-day she does not consider it safe to have them even in Connaught, and 
		as she cannot send them direct to hell she must ship them to America, if 
		America will let her.</font></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><font size="4">The goods 
		that were collected in Dublin for the Chicago fair had all been shipped 
		to America; James Stephens considered it would promote the interests of 
		the organization to have him take a trip across the Atlantic, and the 
		trip was made. He had commissioned his work in Ireland to an executive 
		body of three, consisting of Mr. Luby, Mr. O'Leary and Charles J. 
		Kickham. This commission was given In writing and the written document 
		turned up at the trials afterward, having been found at the house of Mr. 
		Luby the night of his arrest; it was known as the executive document.</font></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><font size="4">James 
		Stephens remained in America during the summer of 1864. He visited 
		several camps of the Union Army, visited several cities, was at the 
		Chicago fair and brought with him back to Ireland most of the money 
		proceeds of that fair. I think it was about August he returned to 
		Ireland. He set vigorously to work to strengthen the organization, to 
		encourage the men and to give thorn hope of immediate action. He 
		appointed a day for meeting the centers who were in the districts in the 
		neighborhood of Dublin, and about forty or fifty of them attended. They 
		came from the counties of Wicklow, Wexford, Carlow, Kildare, Kilkenny, 
		Queens, Kings, Tipperary, Galway, Westmeath, Meath, Louth and Dublin. 
		The meeting was on a Sunday, at a hotel in Delgany, in the County 
		Wicklow. Dinner had been previously engaged for the party, as if they 
		were an excursion party from Dublin. After dinner the room was cleared 
		of all but the invited guests, and the Captain, as we used to call Mr. 
		Stephens, stood up to tell us the news. He gave cheering accounts of all 
		he saw in America and told us, collectively and individually, to bear in 
		mind that next year was to be the year of action—the year of Ireland's 
		fight for Ireland's freedom. When ho said that, there were cheers upon 
		cheers in that dining hall and every center who was present went back to 
		his district rejoicing that he had such glorious news to tell his men.</font></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><font size="4">When I 
		met Mr. Stephens next day he told me the north of Ireland and the west 
		of Ireland should be visited and be informed of the good news he brought 
		from America. He had decided to send me to the north and to make 
		connection with John Nolan, of Carlow, who was doing business in Belfast 
		and who would give me introductions to the most important men. I was 
		then to travel through the district of Connaught and to make connections 
		with Edward Duffy, of Roscommon, who would travel around with me. Mr. 
		Stephens had sent other organizers through Leinster and Munster, and 
		very soon the men in every county of Ireland were thinking of nothing 
		but of the coming fight next year. The pike makers who were in Dublin 
		were instructed to carry on their work vigorously, the number of 
		organizers among the English soldiers was increased and several of the 
		centers in England were asked over to Dublin to hold consultation with 
		the chief of the organization. Before I left Dublin on my mission for 
		Ulster I happened to say something to the captain that went very near 
		making him eat the face off me. While he was in America the task of 
		running the newspaper fell upon my shoulders, not the task of editing it 
		or writing for it, because in that department were Messrs. O'Leary, 
		Luby, Kickham and Mulcahy, but the task of finding money to pay the 
		printers and pay all the other demands that were connected with the 
		business department. I found It pretty hard to make ends meet sometimes, 
		as the priests and the landlords in several places were breaking up our 
		agencies and the money returns were consequently decreasing, so I 
		suggested to Mr. Stephens that it would be well to hold some of his 
		resources in reserve for the paper, lest the promised monthly supplies 
		from America should fail to arrive. He got vexed at my suggesting this; 
		he said the supplies should come and that he had made his calculations 
		and had based the success of his work on the fulfillment of the promises 
		made to him. He would spend in preparation and in organization for the 
		coming month what he had to spend, even though a dollar of the supplies 
		promised for the month after that were never to come. In one sense he 
		was right, but in another sense I thought it would be no harm to hold a 
		little of the fund in reserve for fear of accident. That is one thing I 
		have to say of James Stephens: he never hoarded up any of the 
		organization money in view of a rainy day coming in the future of his 
		own life, or in the future of any life connected with him, When he got 
		money from America he promptly spent it in furthering the work of the 
		organization. I provided myself with letters of introduction to several 
		good men in Ulster who had been in the Tenant League movement, but who 
		had been dead in politics since the Sadliers and Keoghs put a nail in 
		its coffin. I had a. letter to Dr. McKnight, of Derry, who was editor of 
		the <i>Derry Journal</i>, and to Thomas Neilson Underwood, of Strabane, 
		who was a grandnephew of Thomas Neilson, the United Irishman of 1798. I 
		met these gentlemen, and from them I got letters to others. I thus got 
		into the Presbyterian element of the people.</font></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><font size="4">I met 
		John Nolan in Belfast; he had charge of the carpet department of a large 
		dry goods house on the square; he could not well got away from business 
		till Saturday evening and we made arrangements to go to Newtownards in 
		the County Down on Sunday morning. Sunday morning came and we found 
		ourselves in Newtownards. In the course of the day we found ourselves at 
		the hotel In company with thirty or forty men, who had already been 
		sworn in its members of the organization. The impression that meeting 
		made on my mind remains on it still and will remain on it so long as I 
		remain on earth. About a third of the men were Catholics, a third 
		Presbyterians and a third Episcopalian Protestants. A few years before 
		that the Protestants had been Orangemen and the Catholics had been 
		Ribbonmen, having no association or acquaintanceship with each other, 
		but one hating the other as if it were a necessary article of his 
		religion. The Orangeman admitted that before he joined the society he 
		imagined he had no enemy on earth but the Ribbonman, and the Ribbonman 
		admitted that before he joined he imagined he had no greater enemy in 
		the world than the Orangeman; each acknowledged that he considered he 
		could do no better act on earth than to slay the other; and there they 
		were that day around that board shaking hands and thanking God that 
		their eyes were opened and that they were meeting as brothers in the 
		common cause of fatherland.</font></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><font size="4">Present 
		at that meeting was Colonel William MacWilliams, a Presbyterian resident 
		of Newtownards, who a few years ago lived in Baltimore and was on the 
		staff of the Governor of Maryland, and who is now living in Palatka, 
		Fla. The memory of that day spent in the &quot;black north&quot; brightened many 
		of the darkest days of my prison life afterward, and I cherish the 
		recollection of it still. Immerged in a black hole cell in the English 
		prison of Chatham, with no light and with little food, I found exercise 
		for my thoughts in reflections upon the sad condition of affairs in my 
		native land that set brother fighting against brother—to the destruction 
		of their liberty and their happiness, and I passed away the hours 
		stretched in that dark dungeon composing verses that spoke the thoughts 
		passing through my mind. If there be any poetry in the verses it was 
		Newtownards inspired it. There is strong language in them no 
		doubt—language stronger than I dare speak to-day, because to-day I am 
		surrounded by the busy world outside a prison, amenable to all the 
		world's prejudices and punishable for trespassing upon them. But just as 
		a matter of curiosity and to show how free the soul of a man can be even 
		when his body is chained, I will print hero the prison rhymes I am 
		speaking of:</font></p>

		<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><font size="4">I further 
		occupied my time by translating those lines into the Gaelic tongue: 
		there are Highlanders and Inlanders reading the <i>BROOKLYN EAGLE</i> 
		who read Gaelic, and apart from the history of the Fenian movement they 
		will not be displeased that this paper will take to their homes the 
		following Gaelic translation of the foregoing verses:</font></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><i><span lang="FR">
		<font size="4">EIRE TRASNA 'N T-SAILE</font></span></i><span lang="FR"><font size="4">.&nbsp;
		</font></span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><font size="4">[Gaelic 
		Verses repeat the poem above and are omitted from this transcription]</font></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><font size="4">&nbsp;</font></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><font size="4">When I 
		look over those lines and over the sentiments they speak, I begin to 
		think how much more free and independent the Soul of a man is when he is 
		in prison than when he is out of prison. The thought would never come 
		into my head to-day of recording such sentiments in prose or verse, 
		though I live in free America to-day. And it is very likely that even 
		for reproducing them In the <i>EAGLE </i>I will subject myself to the 
		censure of very many narrow minds—well, not narrow minds, but selfish 
		minds—minds that will not express themselves as they feel and think, 
		because doing so is dangerous to pocket and popularity. That is another 
		of the causes of the collapse of Fenianism. Its temporary failure led to 
		its unpopularity, its unpopularity led to the creation of the opinion 
		that it was not respectable to be associated with it; the friends of 
		England cast ridicule upon it, and the friends of Ireland allowed them, 
		and thus allowed them to create the giant which now crushes them, the 
		giant that makes a man like me a boycotted man in society, an outcast in 
		society I may say, because I dare to be free and independent enough to 
		speak as I think. Nine-tenths of the Irishmen in America feel and think 
		about Ireland and England as I do, feel and think that Ireland or any 
		other enslaved country is justified in using toward its emancipation 
		such arms and means of warfare as the enslaver is using and is ready to 
		use toward its enslavement. If I speak individually to any Irishman in 
		New York or Brooklyn to-day, nine out of ten of the Irish born people 
		agree with me in every opinion I hold. If I speak to them collectively, 
		or rather if they express themselves collectively at public meeting, 
		nine out of ten of them will publicly condemn the vary things they 
		privately or personally approve. This is slavery, and it helps very much 
		to hold Ireland enslaved, to see Ireland's children in America afraid to 
		speak the truth, thus allowing the opinion to grow that the means 
		England uses to carry on her wars and to hold subject nations enslaved 
		are honorable, while if Ireland or the subject nations use the same 
		means to rid themselves of the enslavement they are 
		dishonorable.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </font></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><font size="4">The week 
		after the Sunday I spent at Nowtownards I went to Newry to Scarva, to 
		Guilford to Loughbrickland, to Rathfriland to Carrickfergus, to Lisburn, 
		Antrim, Randalstown, Ballycastle, Ballymoney and Ballymena. John Nolan, 
		now dead and buried in America, was with me in some of the places, and 
		some very strange experiences came our way. A friend in Ballymena was 
		seeing us off on the train that was going to start for Randalstown. We 
		were waiting at the Ballymena Station till the train would be ready to 
		start, when suddenly our companion darted away from us, and ran behind a 
		railway carriage. We were surprised; we got into a carriage; he came to 
		the window at the off side of the station, and asking him what was the 
		matter. &quot;Didn't you see the priest coming up?&quot; said he, &quot;he knows me, 
		and he'd know ye were strangers, and if he saw me in your company he 
		would immediately suspect what your business was.&quot; This man was not 
		afraid of the police or of the magistrates, to be seen with us, but when 
		he saw Father Kelly, his parish priest coining toward us, he ran away 
		and hid himself.</font></p>
