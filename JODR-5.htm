		<p class="MsoNormal" align="center" style="text-align: center">&nbsp;</p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify"><font size="4">The 
		breaking out of War in America made Fenianism active in Ireland. England 
		had taken the side of the South, not for the love of the Southerns, but 
		for the love of seeing the Union disrupted. The English newspapers and 
		English statesmen were proclaiming that the Republic was a failure, and 
		there was no great secret made of the fitting out of ships to aid the 
		Southern cause. The organizers in Ireland, anticipating that England 
		would go so far as to make war between America and England inevitable, 
		redoubled their energy in preparing for the &quot;opportunity.&quot; I went to see 
		the American Consul in Queenstown, and had an interview with him; the 
		particulars of that interview it is unnecessary to relate here. England 
		went very far to provoke America at the time, and she might have gone 
		further were it not that Ireland was between England and America and 
		that thousands of Irishmen were ready to strike her on all sides it they 
		only got the chance.</font></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify"><font size="4">On the 
		other hand the English authorities in Ireland were putting forth all 
		their powers to keep the people in subjection. Though no coercion act 
		was legally in force, the magistrates and police took the law into their 
		own hands and acted as if the Coercion act was a living law. They 
		suppressed meetings and gatherings of the people by threats and by a 
		show of force. The year 1863 in Ireland was a very lively year. The 
		Fenian organization had spread into every province and county, the men 
		were active in getting up public meetings under one pretense or another 
		and alarm was increasing.</font></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify"><font size="4">In 
		company with five or Six young men I went to Union Hall one Sunday, a 
		village on the seashore, four miles south of Skibbereen; we met some of 
		the friends there, went into a hotel and had some refreshments. Our 
		recruiting company grew large by degrees, and speeches, recitations and 
		songs came to be in order. We left Union Hall about ten o'clock and 
		walked back to Skibbereen. Next morning there was a rumor spread far and 
		wide that the Fenians had landed and wore marching from the sea all 
		night. The women from Union Hall who came into Skibbereen on Monday 
		morning, with their baskets of fresh fish to sell, came into my shop and 
		said they met on the road the magistrate of Union Hall, John Limrick, 
		and that he was raging mad, cursing and swearing that if he caught me in 
		Union Hall again he'd make it a sore day for me. &quot;Tell him,&quot; said I, 
		&quot;that I’ll be down there again next Sunday.&quot; Those women spoke the Irish 
		language, and it was in the Irish language I spoke to them; but there is 
		no use in my telling my story in the Irish language here; it would be 
		Greek to many of our readers.</font></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify"><font size="4">The 
		rumor spread through the country that we would go to Union Hall next 
		Sunday again, and that rumor was met by another one from the English 
		side of the house that if we went we would never come back alive; that 
		we would be shot down like dogs. It would never do for us to be 
		intimidated; our cause would lose prestige. Sunday morning came, and 
		after mass and breakfast some twenty or thirty of us from Skibbereen 
		were on the road toward Union Hall. Limrick, the magistrate, had sent 
		out requisitions to all the surrounding police barracks, calling the 
		police to Union Hall that day, and on Sunday morning the police were 
		marching in from Ross, Drinagh, Leap, Drimoleage, Ceharagh, Skibbereen, 
		Glendore and Castletownsend. War and rumors of war were in the air, and 
		the people the country around, seeing the armed police marching on the 
		several roads toward Union Hall, followed them into the little city. The 
		Men from Ross brought a band of music with them. They crossed the bay 
		from Glendore in boats, and as the boats approached the quay at Union 
		Hall Limrick, the magistrate, stood there and forbade them to land. I 
		stood alongside of Limrick and told the men not to be driven back by 
		such petty tyranny as this. That this was Irish soil and they had as 
		good a right to tread it as Limrick had. Patrick and James Donovan, who 
		are now in New York, steered their boat into shallow water and leaped 
		ashore; the other men in the boat leaped after them. The bandsmen went 
		to the house of Father Kingston and remained there for a short time.</font></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify"><font size="4">Limrick 
		issued orders that all the public houses in the town be closed, and the 
		police went from house to house, ordering the proprietors to shut shop. 
		I was at Mrs. Collins' hotel when Sergeant Curran came in and ordered 
		Mrs. Collins to turn out all who were in the house and lock the doors. I 
		was in the house. I was married to Mrs. Collins' niece. I asked Mrs. 
		Collins would she order me out. She said she would not. There turning to 
		the policeman I said &quot;Now, Sergeant, if you put your hand on me and tell 
		me I must leave the house I'll leave it; otherwise I'll stay here as 
		long as it suits me. &quot;He said he was only obeying orders; that he had no 
		orders to lay hands on me and would not do it. He went out and I 
		remained in. Mrs. Collins then asked me to take the people out, as she'd 
		be sure to lose her license unless she obeyed Limrick's orders and 
		closed the home. So out we went.</font></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify"><font size="4">As we 
		got on the street the bandsmen were returning from the priests' house 
		with a crowd of the people after them. The police stopped them and 
		ordered them to disperse; Patrick Donovan was arrested by the policemen. 
		Some girls named Dillon, who were first cousins of his, rushed out of 
		their house, took him out of the hands of the police and carried him 
		into the house. Inspector Potter was in command of the police, and he 
		was subject to Linirick's orders. John Sydney Townsend and Dr. 
		Somerville, two other magistrates, were present with Limrick. Limrick 
		ordered Potter to prepare for action and proceeded to read the Riot act. 
		Potter ordered the police to fix bayonets and load. The women in the 
		houses were looking out the windows, and the alarm of their cries so the 
		policemen wore fixing bayonets is still in my mind. I walked up to the 
		three magistrates, saying: &quot;What do you mean by this proceeding. Mr. 
		Limrick &quot;Do you want blood shed hero to-day?&quot; John O'Driscoll, a school 
		teacher.—dismissed a week after for attending that meeting—now in 
		Boston, was by my side, and he asked some other question. Limrick said 
		he wanted no blood shed, but he wanted the disturbance put down. We told 
		him it was he who was creating all the disturbance, and if he wished to 
		carry it farther he might do so and take the consequences. We had no 
		intention to do hurt or harm to any one, but we had a right to tread our 
		native land, and would maintain that right. Patrick Spillane, now in 
		Rochester or Syracuse, then spoke to the magistrate. I looked around, 
		and seeing the band master, Dan O'Donoghue, who, by the way, was a 
		Protestant, struggling with a policeman who was trying to wrest his 
		trombone from him I went over and told Dan to give him the trombone. The 
		magistrates did not give orders to the police to charge or fire, and the 
		day passed off without any bloodshed.</font></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify"><font size="4">Next day 
		I went into the Beecher Arms Hotel in Skibbereen, and met John Sydney 
		Townsend. He asked me to have a drink. &quot;I will,&quot; said I, &quot;after your 
		nearly killing me yesterday.&quot; Then he began speaking of the work 
		yesterday. He had been a traveler in his early days, he had been In 
		Australia, and it was from there he got the name of &quot;Sydney.&quot; &quot;Now, Mr. 
		Townsend,&quot; said I, &quot;If you were in any other land on God's earth but 
		this unfortunate land of ours, and found yourself hunted and banned as 
		we were there yesterday, because you were Irish, wouldn't you resent it, 
		and perhaps resist it?&quot; &quot;Yes, by —; and look at this that I got from a 
		crowd of Englishmen I found running down Ireland&quot;—here he had his coat 
		off and had my hand placed on a dislocated shoulder blade he got in a 
		fight with a crowd of Englishmen in Australia. Occurrences similar to 
		that I described In Union Hall were occurring in other parts of Ireland 
		in connection with the work of organization. It is not a love of egotism 
		but a love of truth that makes me take this one to illustrate the 
		opposition and difficulties that were to be met in the progress of that 
		work ; the things witnessed myself I can speak more correctly of than of 
		things I did not witness.</font></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify"><font size="4">
		England's Prince of Wales was married on the 10th of March, 1863, and on 
		that night all who were loyal, or pretended to be loyal to England in 
		Ireland were displaying their loyalty in illuminations. The people who 
		were rebels were not willing that the other brand should be put upon 
		them, and they resisted the imposition of it by smashing the 
		illuminations in many places. In Dublin the students of the Queen's 
		College cut off the gas and left the college in darkness; in rebel Cork 
		the rebels smashed the illuminated windows of the Queen's, old castle, 
		of Sir John Arnott's establishment, and of other illuminated places. In 
		Skibbereen we had a public news room, in which the bylaws, rules and 
		regulations allowed no politics or political discussions or 
		demonstrations. I was a member of that news room. The subscription was a 
		guinea a year. On the evening of the day of the Prince of Wales' 
		marriage John O'Driscoll came into my shop, exclaiming &quot;Rossa, the news 
		room is illuminated! Aren't you a member of it Are you joining in the 
		illuminations?&quot; I walked out and went to the news room, and there, sure 
		enough, were the candles and gewgaws in the window. I went in and I put 
		the Candles out. William Everett, who is now in New York and who was a 
		right hand man of Richard B. Connolly's and a secretary of the St. 
		Patrick's Alliance when I came out here to America from prison, was the 
		Honorary Secretary of our Newsroom Society in Skibbereen; he was the 
		first man to come into the room after I put out the lights. &quot;What is all 
		this about?&quot; said he. &quot;’Tis I ought to ask what is all this about?&quot; said 
		I. &quot;Why was this room illuminated tonight? Don't you know the rules 
		there forbid the introduction of any politics in this room?&quot; &quot;But there 
		was a meeting of members here to-day and they passed a resolution to 
		illuminate the room.&quot;Where was I from that meeting, why did not you send 
		me a notice to attend it; have you not been paid my subscription, and am 
		I not a member of this newsroom in good standing?&quot;</font></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify"><font size="4">&quot;Well, 
		I’Il call another meeting now and have those candles relit.&quot;</font></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify"><font size="4">&quot;You may 
		call the meeting, but I greatly doubt that you'll have the candles 
		relit.&quot;</font></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify"><font size="4">Mr. 
		Everett went out, and Mrs. Doyle, the lady who owned the hotel, came in 
		exclaiming:</font></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify"><font size="4">&quot;Oh, for 
		goodness sake, Mr. O'Donovan, don't destroy me.&quot;</font></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify"><font size="4">&quot;Never 
		fear, Mrs. Doyle: I won't destroy you; tell me how comes it that this 
		room is illuminated tonight?</font></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify"><font size="4">&quot;I'll 
		tell you, but for the Lord's sake don't speak of it. Mr. Robinson, the 
		magistrate, gave me £7 to illuminate the whole house, and he thought it 
		would spoil the effect of the illuminations if the newsroom windows were 
		kept dark, so they had a meeting in the newsroom and they passed a 
		resolution to illuminate those windows too.&quot;</font></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify"><font size="4">Here Mr. 
		Everett made his appearance accompanied by several of the members; one 
		by one they came, till about twenty were in the room. Samuel Riordan was 
		voted to the chair, and some one of the Loyalists proceeded to the 
		lighting of the candles in the windows. I looked a little black at that 
		proceeding but said nothing. Doctor Donovan opened the ball; he 
		arraigned me for acting improperly in putting out the lights. I referred 
		to the rules and regulations that forbade politics to enter that room; 
		he said the lighting of the room was no politics; I said it wes, and 
		politics of the basest kind; he said a meeting called that day had 
		decided to light the room; I said I should have been called to that 
		meeting. Father O'Brien said he remarked at the meeting that O'Donovan 
		Rossa as a member would object to the illuminations; Father Davis said 
		he regretted I was not notified to attend the meeting, as it would do 
		away with any justification I may have for protesting, The room was 
		getting hot—hot every way—the candle light, the gaslight and the hot 
		words; the chairman told some one to let down the windows a little. The 
		fight went on, and as I answered every one who assailed me the crowd in 
		the street kept cheering me on; Doctor Donovan said something loyal; the 
		crowd at the window, groaned and hissed at it. &quot;There is no order at 
		this meeting,&quot; said he, &quot;there is no law here but mob law.&quot; &quot;Well, Mr. 
		Chairman,&quot; said I, as the doctor says there is no law here but mob law, 
		and as you allowed him to say it without reprimand, we may as well have 
		the full benefit of that law,&quot; and, making for the windows, I tore down 
		the flags, fidols and candles and throw them into the street. I had then 
		to run abide —not from the men in the room, but from the men in the 
		street ; they soon found me out though, tossed me on their shoulders, 
		and I had hardly a stitch of clothes on me when they landed me at home. 
		No, no, the Irish people are not loyal to England; they love not English 
		rule; who say they do say what is most untrue—so notoriously untrue that 
		it may be said they lie.</font></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify"><font size="4">About 
		this time the Poles were fighting for the freedom of their land. Prince 
		Albert, before he died, said the Poles were as little deserving of 
		sympathy as the Irish, and the Irish thought it would not be amiss to 
		get up some demonstration of sympathy for them. A meeting was announced 
		to take place in Skibbereen and the boys were preparing torchlights for 
		the procession. The Government took alarm, knowing that it was the Irish 
		Revolutionary Brotherhood men were at the back of the demonstration. Not 
		knowing what may be hidden in their designs, not knowing but a rising in 
		rebellion may be contemplated, all the police in the bar[o]nies 
		adjoining wore drawn into the town the night of the demonstration, and 
		the peasantry, seeing the police marching into town, followed them in. 
		The streets were crowded. We got some thousands of handbills printed and 
		got boys to distribute them into the hands of police and people, 
		particularly into the hands of the police. The magistrates were raging 
		mad at our doing such a thing, as the handbill ran this way &quot;To the 
		People—Friends You come together this evening to express your sympathy 
		with a people who, like ourselves, desire to be free from oppression. 
		The English agents among us take alarm or pretend to take alarm, and 
		they summon into the town all the military forces at their command. You 
		see the town full of armed police, but we advise you not to offend by 
		word or act any of these police. They are Irishmen like ourselves, 
		feeling the same yoke perhaps, many of them our friends possibly, but 
		appearing from circumstances to be our enemies.</font></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify"><font size="4">
		&quot;[Signed] &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; By order of the committee.&quot; </font></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify"><font size="4">That 
		handbill was gall and wormwood to the two stipendiary special 
		magistrates and the half a dozen other magistrates who came to town to 
		suppress the meeting. They tried many of their arts during the evening 
		to get the promoters of it to withdraw. Friendly policemen and the wives 
		of friendly policemen who lived in town went secretly to the wives and 
		mothers of some of our men and in the greatest confidence whispered to 
		them that there would be bloody work that night, as the police had got 
		secret instructions to be ready to fire on the mob. About six o'clock in 
		the evening a very worthy woman sent for me. She was the mother of one 
		of our most active young men. I went to gee her. She told me she had it 
		in the greatest confidence and on the very best authority that the 
		police were going to shoot us down that night, and she begged of me to 
		stop the demonstration. I told her it was not in my power to do such a 
		thing; that I was only one of a committee of twenty, and that what she 
		heard wes only one of the tricks of the police magistrates to frighten 
		the people. She entreated me to listen seriously to her, and at last she 
		went down on her knees begging of me to grant her request and save the 
		people. It was about as painful a position as ever I was in, because she 
		was a woman worthy of respect and every one of her family was dear to 
		me. I had to tear myself away from her and go to discharge the duty laid 
		upon me as being one of the committee to load the procession. As I got 
		to the head of the procession at the place of meeting the torches were 
		lighting, and the husband of the lady I had just left was trying to 
		extinguish them as fast as they were lit. He too had been persuaded that 
		we were about to be shot down if we went on with the procession, and he 
		was using physical force to save us from destruction. He was a man all 
		the town respected, and none of the boys would hurt him. They relit the 
		torches as fast as tie extinguished them. The time came for the 
		procession to move, the committee were at the bead of it, and as the 
		orders were given to march, the magistrates, surrounded by police, 
		blocked the street in front and stopped our march. O'Connell, the big 
		stipendiary magistrate, was in command of the forces. He spoke and 
		ordered us to disperse. We made a move to advance and were stopped by 
		the police. &quot;Who are the ringleaders of this business?&quot; asked O'Connell 
		of the commander of the police? &quot;Here they are, your honor,&quot; said the 
		policeman, pointing out the men of the committee, Conn O'Callaghan, 
		Daniel McCartie, Morty Moynahan, John O'Driscoll, Tom O'Sullivan, 
		Patrick Carey, Charles McCarthy, Jerry O'Meara, O'Donovan Rossa and some 
		others. O'Connell, addressing us, said: &quot;I order this meeting to 
		disperse.&quot;&nbsp;&nbsp; I</font></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify"><font size="4">
		Committee—Why don't you let it disperse? You and the police are blocking 
		the way here.</font></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify"><font size="4">&quot;This is 
		a riotous and illegal meeting and I cannot allow it to go on.&quot;</font></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify"><font size="4">&quot;‘Tis a 
		quiet and orderly meeting and a quite legal one, and it is you and your 
		police who are making the riotous demonstration.&quot;</font></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify"><font size="4">
		O'Connell—I'll read the Riot act, and then if you don't disperse you 
		will have to take the consequences. </font></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify"><font size="4">
		Committee—You had better do nothing that will bring on a fight here. We 
		are not to be intimidated, and if you order bloodshed let the 
		consequences be on your head.</font></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify"><font size="4">We were 
		some 4,000 strong and the police about 400. Ho read the Riot act and 
		again ordered the people to disperse, as the meeting was illegal.</font></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify"><font size="4">
		Committee—What do you see illegal in the meeting?</font></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify"><font size="4">&quot;Those 
		flags there.&quot;</font></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify"><font size="4">&quot;Take 
		down those flags and banners along the line of procession!&quot;</font></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify"><font size="4">The men 
		passed the command along, and in a minute, from front to roar of the 
		procession—a quarter of a mile long--every flag was lowered.</font></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify"><font size="4">&quot;Now do 
		you see anything else in the procession that you would call 
		illegal?&quot;&quot;Those torches there.&quot;</font></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify"><font size="4">&quot;Put out 
		those torches!&quot; and the torches were extinguished immediately,</font></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify"><font size="4">
		&quot;Anything else illegal, Mr. O'Connell?&quot;</font></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify"><font size="4">&quot;I order 
		you to disperse.&quot;</font></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify"><font size="4">&quot;Then 
		let us disperse; you and those police there are blocking the way on us, 
		and we cannot move. Get out of our way.&quot;</font></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify"><font size="4">He and 
		the other magistrates moved aside and ordered the police to move aside. 
		We passed on, and in regular order the procession marched through every 
		street of the town before it dispersed. It came to a halt at the 
		Windmill Hill; there a few of the torches were lit, and an address of 
		sympathy with the Poles was read.</font></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify"><font size="4">One of 
		the flags in the procession was a red flag, with a triangle on it, and 
		this John O'Gorman—now in Tuckahoe, N.Y.—Jerri O'Meara and John 
		O'Driscoll, took to the top of my house, and planted on the chimney. 
		Next day the flag caused as great a flutter among the authorities as the 
		procession did. The people coming into town saw the red flag floating, 
		and the rumor spread that the long wished for fight with the enemy was 
		surely coining at last. O'Connell sent for me, and asked me to take down 
		the flag. I told him it wasn't illegal to have it up; it was not a 
		shamrock flag or a sunburst flag or a harp of Erin flag, it was only a 
		simple piece of red calico, and certainly that wasn't going to frighten 
		the British empire. I wasn't going to take it down. He threatened he 
		would have me brought up for sentence, and I told him he may do his 
		best. I was not called up that time, but the flag remained up till the 
		breezes tore it down.</font></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify"><font size="4">I soon 
		came to learn that the landlords in my neighborhood had resolved to 
		boycott me, The landlords' agents had whispered it into the ears of the 
		tenants that the masters did not at all approve of buying goods at my 
		store. Tom Somerville, the deputy Lord Lieutenant of the county used to 
		buy farm seeds in my store; he wrote to me asking would I not look 
		before me and see how unbecoming it was in me to be pursuing a course 
		that was likely to ruin my business, ruin myself and ruin my family. 
		Somerville was a great friend of mine—that is, friend in the way of 
		doing many little things which a man in power is often in the way of 
		doing for a man in trade. One branch of my business was the wine and 
		spirit business; it was necessary to get my license renewed every year, 
		and every year since I was put to prison some policeman came forward at 
		Petty Sessions to object to my getting a license. The objection held 
		good, the Petty Sessions magistrates would not grant the license, I'd 
		have to appeal to the barrister at Quarter Sessions, Tom Somerville 
		always sat alongside the barrister and whispered my license into his 
		ear. How Tom Somerville became a great friend of mine is a little story 
		in itself, and as it will make a little bit of light reading in the 
		progress of Fenianism I'll tell it:</font></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify"><font size="4">When I 
		was young I had the making of a poet in me, and had I cultivated poetry 
		instead of politics during my life I could easily be richer than I am 
		today. Politics do not pay well when they are run by straight people. It 
		is only when you run them crooked that you grow rich. It was by rhyming 
		I came to earn Tom Somerville's friendship. He had a son in the Crimean 
		war. Thu account came one day that he was killed, and the father was in 
		great grief. Many of the neighbors wore sorry, because Tom Somerville 
		was a very easy going, plausible man, and as fine a looking man as you'd 
		see in a day's walk. A few days after the account of the son's death 
		came another account came that he was living and then came the news that 
		he was coming home, and there was rejoicing among his friends. I had the 
		reputation of being the local poet and I was asked to write some lines 
		for the occasion. I wrote them. I sent them to Tom Somerville, and next 
		day, when he came to town, he called at my house and thanked me, telling 
		me to look upon him as a friend while he lived. The lines are still In 
		my head and I'll get them out now. Here they are:</font></p>

		<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; margin-left: .5in">
		<font size="4">Valor's representative, Skibbereen will gladly greet him</font></p>

		<font size="4">Imbued with feelings of respect she joyfully will meet

		<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; margin-left: .5in">
		<font size="4">Loudly to home she'll welcome him, old friends, old

		<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; margin-left: .5in">

		<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; margin-left: .5in">
		<font size="4">Enjoyed to see that he again has met his honored father.</font></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify"><font size="4">That 
		father died two years ago at Drisbane Castle, Caetletownsend. I was 
		sorry to have lost a personal friend even though he was a friend in the 
		service of the enemy. The son, about whom those acrostic lines were 
		written—Major Thomas Somerville—succeeds the father to the magistracy 
		and the lieutenancy of the County Cork. I suppose he would have to 
		discharge the duty of arresting me now if I put in au appearance in my 
		native home.</font></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify"><font size="4">I began 
		to feel that the boycotting of me by the landlords and the landlords' 
		agents was bidding fair to ruin my trade. Farmers, who would want to buy 
		farm seeds of me, would come in the middle of the night and wake me up 
		out of bed to get supplied with what they wanted. Some landlords paid 
		half the price of the clover seeds and hay seeds the tenants put in the 
		ground, but if the seeds were bought from me they'd pay nothing. As a 
		matter of course, those customers of mine had to buy elsewhere. In the 
		peaceful, constitutional agitation of Irishmen for Ireland's rights 
		England can get tile better of Ireland any day. With all the arts of man 
		you cannot get the bettor of England unless you have power to strike her 
		down. If you organize to get that power and she sees you have it, then 
		she is likely to make concession. My experience of England—and I have a 
		pretty fair experience of her, having been a prisoner in ten of her 
		English prisons—runs parallel with James Anthony Froude's experience of 
		her. Froude, in his lectures in New York, tried to teach our Irish 
		people a lesson, but our Irish People will not learn it. He told them if 
		they wanted Ireland's freedom they would have to pay for it the price of 
		freedom—they would have to pay blood for it, because it is by blood 
		England won it. Irish patriots in America and Irish patriots in Ireland 
		would win Ireland's freedom by oratory and tall talk and by slashing 
		newspaper editorials. Froude tells us &quot;it is not to oratory and 
		newspaper articles that the fates award the crown of national 
		independence.&quot; But when the fates award the crown of patriotism to the 
		orators and the newspaper writers who do the tall talking and writing, 
		it is little wonder that Fenianism has temporarily collapsed, and that 
		the oleomargarine article of patriotism has temporarily taken its place.</font></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify"><font size="4">Froude's 
		words in New York thirteen years ago made an impression on my mind; they 
		fell waste upon the minds of others. It is worth while to record them 
		here; it will be necessary to bear them in mind in my future letters, 
		because I am now leaving Ireland for a while and coming to America, 
		where abound in thousands the patriots who free Ireland without striking 
		a blow—the patriots who prey upon the miseries and misfortunes of a 
		fallen land and a stricken people.</font></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify"><font size="4">&quot;I am 
		not here in New York,&quot; said Mr. Froude, &quot;to talk commonplaces about 
		English tyranny or Irish acrimony, but the fact remains that at this 
		day, after seven hundred years of forced connection, we are still 
		unmatched. If the votes of the Irish population were taken man for man 
		two-thirds would ask for a separation, immediate and eternal. It stands 
		confessed before all the world that after all our efforts we have not 
		made friends. Seven centuries of injury divide us. They desire us simply 
		to get away and leave them to manage their own affairs, in their own 
		way, as best they please. &nbsp;• &nbsp;• &nbsp;• To have to part from a high spirited 
		and brilliant race, to whom we have given our laws and language, who 
		have distinguished themselves in our institutions, would be a disgrace 
		to our statesmanship, but if the Irish persisted in it we could not deny 
		that the experiment of a forced union has been tried long enough. We 
		should be obliged then to bid them God speed.</font></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify"><font size="4">“But 
		philosophers have not yet discovered how to uproot the soil of Ireland, 
		and so long as England remains a great power, with fleets and navies and 
		commercial interests in every corner of the world, England cannot, 
		England will not let go her hold upon an island lying close under her 
		side. She cannot risk the possibility of a hostile State establishing 
		itself between her and the Atlantic. She will not consent to separation, 
		or to measures designed to bring it about. We cannot commit political 
		suicide. Until England is beaten to her knees Ireland must share the 
		fortunes of the stronger country. If the Irish race refuses to be 
		reconciled to us then we must continue as we are—each a thorn in the 
		other's side—or they must themselves seek another home, or else they 
		must fight for their independence and win it like men. </font></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify"><font size="4">“Should 
		they achieve such an enterprise, though my duty would then be to my 
		country, and though I would struggle to hold Ireland to its obedience, 
		yet as a member of the great brotherhood, when it was done I should 
		willingly welcome them as another among the nations of the earth.</font></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify"><font size="4">&quot;But 
		political freedom, gentlemen, is too precious a jewel to be lightly 
		owned. It is not to oratory and newspaper articles that the fates award 
		the crown of national independence. That crown is the reward only of 
		united, persistent determination to be free—a determination which 
		flinches from no danger, admits of no compromise, but expresses itself 
		in deed as well as in word. &nbsp;•&nbsp; •&nbsp; •&nbsp; To fasten independence upon a 
		people who have never earned it is to give wings to those who have never 
		learned to fly. If I were to sum up in one sentence the secret of 
		Ireland's misfortune, I should say it lay in this: That while from the 
		first she has resisted England, complained of England, appealed to 
		Heaven and earth against the wrongs England has inflicted on her, she 
		has ever invited others to help her, and never herself made an effectual 
		fight with her own forces, •&nbsp; • &nbsp;• Until Ireland is united in its 
		determination to have liberty or die, independence would be a curse to 
		her. &nbsp;&nbsp;• &nbsp;&nbsp;• &nbsp;&nbsp;• &nbsp;Separation we cannot agree to.&quot;</font></p>
		<span style="font-family: Times New Roman"><font size="4">Froude speaks 
		what England feels on the question of Ireland's independence. It is 
		nonsense, and waste of time and money, and hope and expectation, for 
		Irishmen to be thinking or trying to get freedom for Ireland any other 
		way but the way Froude points out &quot;They must fight for it like men; they 
		must strike England to her knees.&quot;</font></span></blockquote>
