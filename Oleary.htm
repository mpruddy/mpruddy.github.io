	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify"><b><font size="4">SENTENCE 
	having been passed on Thomas Clarke Luby, the next selected for a mock trial 
	and certain conviction was John O'Leary. The British Government, in its 
	relentless persecution, has recognized his ability as an editor, and his 
	fidelity as a patriot, and it has not undervalued him in either capacity. 
	Those who knew him depict him as eminently a man of determination, whose 
	mental constitution—&quot; clear and brilliant, manly, sincere and truthful &quot; 
	—gave some idea of those souls &quot;that rendered the Rome of antiquity or the 
	Sparta of Solon the wonder and glory of the world.&quot;</font></b></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify"><b><font size="4">The 
	O'Leary sept are of Milesian descent, and have held territory for ages in 
	the County Cork. It is a prominent name in Irish history, and the family of 
	our hero have been resident in the County Tipperary; and in the town of the 
	same name John O'Leary was born. In that county an active national spirit 
	has al-</font></b></p>

	maintained. There are associations connected with that portion of Ireland 
	which have served to cherish patriotism, to inspire the young mind, and 
	confirm it in devotion to the sacred cause of independence. Situated on its 
	lovely plains is the City of Cashel, whose ruins recall the ancient 
	greatness of our ancestors—the story of the legal murder of Father Sheehy is 
	current among the people—in '98 it experienced the ruthless tyranny of 
	British officials.</font></b></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify"><b><font size="4">In 
	addition we are told that &quot;his home had its own traditions of patriotism, 
	and he should have been a false shoot of the old stock of his hearth, if his 
	good heart and brain were not open to the example, teaching and stimulus of 
	all he derived from birth and locality.&quot;</font></b></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify"><b><font size="4">The 
	enthusiasm which existed in Ireland in 1848, and preceding years, was shared 
	by young O'Leary. The close of the '48 movement left Ireland in a state of 
	disorganized hostility, and, until the formation of the Fenian Brotherhood, 
	there was no extended organization which could realize the patriot's desire 
	of its being the certain means of Ireland's regeneration.</font></b></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify"><b><font size="4">Left with 
	ample means by his parents, Mr. O'Leary devoted himself to study. A 
	naturally strong mind was refined and exalted by full culture. He looked 
	toward a profession, and chose that of medicine. With the purpose of fitting 
	himself for it he went to Queen's College, Cork ; became distinguished, and 
	after giving unmistakable evidence of the national passion which was taking 
	possession of him, he went to France. Whether under imperial or republican 
	rule, residence in France has never failed to confirm the modern pa-</font></b></p>

	his aspirations after freedom ; and all that O'Leary saw in that country 
	only tended to make him more anti-British than before.</font></b></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify"><b><font size="4">It is not 
	surprising, therefore, when Mr. O'Leary left France and extended his travels 
	to the United States, that his whole soul was concentrated on thoughts of 
	Irish liberty. He was warmly received by the veteran Irish patriots in this 
	country, and was considered a valuable member of the &quot;faithful and the few&quot; 
	who were then laying the foundation of an organization which has since 
	extended itself from the Atlantic to the Pacific, and has become the most 
	formidable element, probably, against which England has ever had to contend.</font></b></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify"><b><font size="4">Mr. 
	O'Leary became ardently attached to America and her republican institutions; 
	and the comparison between affairs here and under the British Government, 
	afforded him many a strong argument in favor of freedom when lie returned 
	and took up his residence in London. A gentleman who kindly furnishes some 
	interesting data for this sketch, says he can recall &quot;how ably in literary 
	circles he could defend the national cause, and demonstrate Ireland's claim 
	to independence. One of the many errors which even liberal-minded Englishmen 
	entertain respecting Ireland is, that her material progress is of most 
	importance, in the hopes of accomplishing which, she should resign her 
	aspirations after nationality and become absorbed with England. In these 
	principles Mr. O'Leary could never acquiesce. 'Great, glorious and free,' 
	was his ideal. He knew that as long as English</font></b></p>

	time cannot sanction injustice. Both nations are too dissimilar in race; the 
	past cannot be forgotten; and experience proves that Ireland will never 
	consent to be a British province.&quot;</font></b></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify"><b><font size="4">Another 
	authority says: &quot;He returned to Ireland and threw himself with great skill 
	and great zeal into the work of extending the Fenian organization. Few men 
	of any power of mind, of any patriotism, that he met, were they that were 
	not made sympathizers with the cause to which he devoted himself as to a 
	sacred work. Keenly sagacious and unfailingly determined, beloved and 
	respected, he escaped the Argus eyes of the police unbetrayed, and became 
	the very right hand man, it is said, of the attempt, according to Her 
	Majesty's Attorney-General, to subvert the throne and constitution in 
	Ireland.&quot;</font></b></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify"><b><font size="4">When the 
	Irish People was established, to be the organ of Fenianism, Stephens 
	selected O'Leary as the conductor; and as an evidence of the far-sighted 
	sagacity which controlled, not only O'Leary, but those having authority in 
	the management of that journal, the following from the Shamrock will be in 
	place, especially to those who have not had an opportunity of reading the 
	articles alluded to: &quot;The most careful supervision was exercised over its 
	'leaders' and over its letters ; for, whilst the leaders' generally dealt 
	with the principles admitted by the constitution of 1688, the letters dealt 
	with Fenianism, with the hostility which it met from priests and bishops, 
	and in this way tried out the question by two modes, arguing the</font></b></p>

	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify"><b><font size="4">cause of 
	Fenianism, and spreading its principles in spite of the law. A remarkable 
	testimony to the skill with which this was done, is to be found in the 
	circumstance that the leading journal of high Catholic opinion in England 
	used to quote the leaders of the Irish People, very frequently as the text 
	and gospel of Irish politics, and several Irish daily journals, including 
	the also took the same course. It is asserted, with what authority we know 
	not, that many of the leaders' were submitted to counsel prior to their 
	appearance; and that no doubtful composition was ever suffered to be printed 
	without being subject to that precaution.&quot;</font></b></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify"><b><font size="4">It is 
	believed that, but for the information of the infamous Nagle, who described 
	the People office as a sort of chief bivouac of the organization, the 
	Government would not have convicted the writers for their contributions to 
	the paper alone. As it is, however, no one connected with it has escaped 
	penal servitude.</font></b></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify"><b><font size="4">Mr. 
	O'Leary was arrested at his residence, Palmerston Place.&nbsp; He was arraigned 
	on the 1st December, while the jury on Luby's case were consulting. On their 
	return he was remanded, and brought to trial the next day. He was dressed, 
	as usual, in dark clothes; and as he advanced to the bar, every eye in court 
	was turned towards him. The judges whispered their comments, whilst they 
	noticed him curiously as he took his position in the dock of destiny. Every 
	available space was filled with ladies, &quot;friends of the prisoner.&quot; His

	or not guilty?&quot; he replied, &quot;It is the Government of the country, the Crown 
	prosecutors, the Barrys and Nagles who are guilty, and not I.&quot; They inquire, 
	&quot;Are you ready for trial?&quot; He answers, &quot;I must be ready—the Crown is ready!&quot; 
	and, accordingly, the trial proceeds. Mr. Butt vainly seeks to have an 
	impartial jury empanelled; .the Attorney-General speaks for the Crown; the 
	informer Nagle, and the spy Schofield (sent there by the British Consul at 
	New York,) gave their evidence. Mr. Butt, in an able and argumentative 
	address, defends O'Leary. One incident alone of the trial will show the 
	intensity of his devotion to the principles for which he was to suffer. 
	During Mr. Butt's address he alluded to the Irish People newspaper in a 
	manner which might be construed as speaking discreditably of it. Mr. 
	O'Leary, interrupting him, said he wished to make an observation. Mr. Butt, 
	zealous for the safety of his client, threatened if lie did so to sit down.

	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify"><b><font size="4">It

	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify"><b><font size="4">On the

	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify"><b><font size="4">&quot;My

	—&quot;Very well. Mr. Luby declined to touch upon this from a very natural fear 
	that he might do harm to some of the other prisoners ; but there can be 
	little fear of that now, for a jury that could be found to convict me of 
	this conspiracy, will convict them all. Mr. Luby admitted that he was 
	technically guilty according to that highly elastic instrument, British law, 
	but I did not think that those men there &quot;(pointing to the Crown counsel,) 
	&quot;could make that case against me. And this brings me naturally to the 
	subject upon which there has been much misrepresentation in Ireland—I mean 
	the subject of informers. Mr. Justice Keogh said in his charge against Mr. 
	Luby that men would be found ready for money, or some other motive, to place 
	themselves at the disposal of the Government and make known the designs of a 
	conspiracy. No doubt; men will be always found ready for money to place 
	themselves at the disposal of the Government, but I think it is agitators,

	Luby. He spoke of cattle being driven away, and of houses being burnt down, 
	that men would be killed, and so on. I should like to know if all that does 
	not apply to war as well as to revolution? One word more and I shall have 
	done. I have been found guilty of treason, or of treason-felony. Treason is 
	a foul crime. The poet Dante consigns traitors to, I believe, the ninth 
	circle of Hell ; but what kind of traitors? Traitors against the King, 
	against country, against friends, and against benefactors. England is not my
