<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">SCARCELY less attention has 
been directed to Captain M'Cafferty, than to any of the Fenian prisoners. The 
fact that he is an American by birth, and the legal measures taken, in 
consequence, by his able counsel, to effect his liberation, have kept his case 
constantly before the public, which has lost nothing either by the manly style 
in which the subject has conducted himself.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">The excitement immediately 
following the seizure of the Irish, People party, 1865, and the fear of American 
aid, led the Government to watch the steamers. On the arrival of the City of 
Limerick at Queenstown, 18th September, Captain John M'Cafferty, announced as &quot; 
late of the Confederate army,&quot; was arrested. From his person was taken a waist 
belt, with two six-barrelled revolvers, a rifle, and four works upon drill. One 
was Brigadier General Silas Casey's Infantry Tactics, three volumes; another, 
Lieutenant Colonel Philip St. George Cook's work on military movements, with 
illustrations by Colonel George Patten, late United States Army; the third, the 
&quot; A. B. C.&quot;</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">of Skirmishing and Movements 
for Infantry, by Wm. Mallon, late Second Royal Middlesex Rifles; and the fourth, 
a School Manual, by Stephen Pinckney, Colonel Ninety-fifth New York National 
Guard. These appearing, as the officials sagaciously said, &quot;to contain every 
information necessary for the management of troops,&quot; the authorities regarded 
the ex-Confederate Captain as a very dangerous character, if not a walking 
arsenal. He was remanded, put in prison, bills found against him, and sent for 
trial to the Special Commission, held in 1865, in Cork, charged with feloneously 
intending to depose the Queen from the style, honor and royal name of the 
Imperial Crown of the United Kingdom ; also, with feloneously intending to levy 
war against the Queen, and of moving foreigners with force to invade Ireland.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">The prisoner pleaded not 
guilty, and his counsel, Mr. Butt, claimed that as the prisoner was an alien, 
half of the jury to try him should be aliens also. The Attorney-General 
requiring to see the foundation of the claim, Mr. Butt read a certificate from 
the District Court of Michigan, United States, that the prisoner, who had been 
in the Confederate army, had taken the oath of allegiance to the United States, 
in May last. He also read the following letter from the United States Consul, at 
Queenstown, to the prisoner, who, after his arrest, applied to him for his 
interference:</p>

<p class="MsoBodyTextIndent">examination of your case, I find, first, that you 
were born in Sandusky, State of Ohio; second, that you deliberately entered the 
rebel army during the war; third, that you took the amnesty oath in the month of 
May last; fourth, that you left New York in September, to go to Paris, to get 
permission from Southern men to go to Mexico; fifth, that you were arrested at 
Queenstown, with revolvers and treasonable documents, involving you in a 
suspicion of complicity with treasonable movements in Ireland. Now, whether your 
statement is true that you were on your way to Paris to consult with men still 
disloyal to the United States; or, whether, as suspected, you are an agent from 
America, combined with the Fenian organization to raise a rebellion in Ireland, 
in either case, you have entirely forfeited all claims to either sympathy or 
support from the United States Government. I return you your oath of allegiance, 
and am your obedient servant,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; E. G. EASTMAN.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyTextIndent">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">Under these circumstances, the 
Government could not resist the suggestion, and the jury was formed as the 
prisoner's counsel desired. On the 16th, counsel having, at the invitation of 
the Justice, discussed the manner in which overt acts alleged against the 
prisoner had been sustained, Mr. Justice Fitzgerald said: “Having carefully 
considered the case last night, the Court had come to the conclusion that there 
was no evidence to sustain an overt act on the part of the prisoner, after 
tender arrived in port. They would direct the jury to acquit him.” The jury, in 
accordance, returned a verdict of acquittal. This fact is important, and bears 
upon the case of Stephen J. Meany, who committed no overt act after his arrival 
in Great Britain, but was found guilty of acts done in America. Captain 
M'Cafferty was released on his own recognizances, and was cheered by the people 
on his liberation. Subse-</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; margin-left: .25in">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">quently, on his way to Dublin, 
he was the object of much attention and sympathy wherever, along the railway 
line, the fact of his presence became known. Men and women pressed forward to 
shake his hand, and congratulate him on his release from captivity.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">On his release from prison, 
Captain M'Cafferty put himself in communication with the Fenian Government in 
Ireland, and was despatched by it to America to explain the extent of the 
movement there, and the reliance placed in the promise of assistance. At the 
great mass meeting held in Jones' Wood, New York, after the suspension of the 
Habeas Corpus Act, in February, at which two hundred thousand persons were 
present, Captain M'Cafferty was introduced as &quot;the envoy of the Irish Republic, 
with important despatches for the order in this country.&quot; He implored his 
hearers to stand by the Irish revolutionary army, which amount to two hundred 
and fifty thousand men. All they wanted was arms and munitions of war. He spoke 
of the discipline which existed, and in the course of his remarks said: </p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoBodyTextIndent">He could not speak to them as eloquently as other 
gentlemen present could. He was only a soldier ; he desired to fight, not to 
talk. Ireland was not even his native country, he was an American by birth ; but 
Ireland was now his adopted country, and it was her cause he was now pleading. 
He was dealing in no extravagances, he was telling them plain facts. Another 
consideration he would impress upon them. In carrying forward the struggle which 
had been inaugurated, they might fail of success. In that case, it would be 
worthy of every Irish-</p>

<p class="MsoBodyTextIndent">man to have something to show that when the 
struggle was going on, he had patriotism enough to aid the cause of his native 
land to the extent of his power ; let him have some token of his patriotism in 
this emergency, to hand down as an heir-loom to his children. Of course there 
were possibilities, though not probabilities, of failure. No one could look into 
the future and predict, with absolute certainty, what would be the issue of this 
contest; but if, perchance, they should fail, the aiders of this movement in 
America, would have the assurance that he would, like many of his comrades, 
leave his bones bleaching on the soil of Ireland.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; margin-left: .5in">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">At this great meeting, 
resolutions were passed, condemnatory of Mr. Adams, the American Ambassador, at 
London, and Mr. Eastman, Consul at Queenstown, for declining to interfere in the 
case of Captain M'Cafferty, because he had been in the Confederate service, and 
notwithstanding that the said &quot;Captain M'Cafferty has taken the amnesty oath 
required by the President, who thereby cast into oblivion all former acts 
against the Government or authority of the United States, and restored said 
Captain M'Cafferty to the full and entire rights of American citizenship.&quot;</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">Captain M'Cafferty attended and addressed the mass 
meetings held in Washington, Philadelphia, and other leading cities. At 
Philadelphia, he said there could be no difference of opinion, among those who 
are informed on the subject, as to where the blow should be struck. The invasion 
of Canada was not to be thought of. It would take three years to compel the 
surrender</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">of Quebec, and to obtain the 
control of the St. Lawrence. He expected to return to Ireland. He promised to do 
so, and he would keep his promise. Most assuredly he did. As he said, he was a 
soldier, and only believed in fighting; consequently he was one of those who 
adhered to the military programme, when Stephens refused to fight in Ireland, 
and immediately started for the theatre of operations. The Attorney General, 
charging M'Cafferty with being the chief instrument, if not the originator of 
the contemplated seizure of Chester Castle, gave an outline of his movements, up 
to the date of his second arrest, based on the information of Corydon.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">The attack was to have been made on Chester on the 11th 
of February; but on Sunday information of the design was given by Corydon to the 
authorities, who were enabled, in consequence, to take the necesary precautions. 
&quot;If that project,&quot; said the Attorney-General, had been carried out, it would be 
impossible to exaggerate the disastrous consequences to this country which might 
hare followed. &quot;M'Cafferty went to Chester some days before the contemplated 
attack, and took apartments at the King's Head, in the name of Frederick 
Johnstone, and remained till Monday. On Sunday morning, the 10th, he was visited 
by two men, and later in the evening by seven more, &quot;who had all the appearance 
of Yankees.&quot; The Government stated that between one thousand four hundred and 
one thousand five hundred strangers arrived in Chester, by train, from Crewe, 
and, other places, but the authorities there were not unprepared.</p>

<p class="MsoBodyText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">M'Cafferty having ordered dinner for two o'clock, went 
out with Flood, and soon found that the matter was blown up. They then 
disappeared. Before leaving, M'Cafferty sent a messenger, one Austin Gibbons, to 
countermand the officers who were coming from Liverpool, by way of Birkenhead, 
and to say that the affair was blown upon. As might be expected, the officers 
found their way one after another to Ireland. On the 19th February, M'Cafferty 
and Flood landed at the port of Whitehaven, in England. They went to a hotel, 
where they stopped till the following day, when they sailed for Dublin in a coal 
brig, called the New Draper. They arrived in Dublin on the 23d day of February. 
Fortunately the authorities were prepared beforehand for their arrival, and a 
watch was kept on the New Draper. At each side of the river police were 
stationed, and as the vessel sailed up the river, they observed two men dropping 
into an oyster boat, which was rowed by three men. The police gave chase in a 
ferry boat, and arrested the men as they got into a collier. They gave their 
names as William Jackson (M'Cafferty) and John Phillips (Flood.) They were 
identified at Mountjoy prison. On being searched in the jail, there was found 
between the cloth and the lining, a gold ring, which would be produced, 
containing a photograph, and inside these words: &quot;Erin, I love thee and thy 
patriots, presented to Captain John M'Cafferty, by the Detroit Circle of the 
Fenian Brothers, as a token of esteem. Detroit, April, 1866.&quot;</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">When the jury retired, in the case of Thomas F. Bourke, 
on the 1st May, M'Cafferty was brought to</p>

<p class="MsoBodyText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">the bar for trial. Mr. Butt applied to the Court for a 
postponement of the trial to the last of the Commission. The application was 
grounded on an affidavit which was verified by the' prisoner, and which set 
forth that he was born in the State of Ohio, in the United States of America, in 
the year 1838; that he was indicted at the last Special Commission for the 
County of Cork, when he was tried by a jury half of whom were foreigners, by 
whom he was acquitted; and that there were certain official documents of the 
Republic of the United States of America, which he believed he would be able to 
produce, to authenticate his affidavit, and which were material and necessary 
for his defence. The Attorney-General, for the purpose of the trial, admitted 
the prisoner to be an alien; when Mr. Butt withdrew his motion for postponement, 
the object of the application having been attained. The trial was proceeded with 
on the following day. He is thus described in court : &quot; Captain John M'Cafferty 
is put forward. I look down at him, as he comes up from where Thomas Bourke and 
Patrick Doran passed in, with his hat upon him, which he now removes. He sits 
down in his accustomed place, and the case goes on. Few men have a face in which 
determination and symmetry are so much blended, as that of John M'Cafferty. It 
is bronzed, too, with the light of battle-fields, where it gleamed amidst the 
lines of Morgan's troops, as they dashed along in many a desperate charge. He 
fixes his gaze always intently upon whoever speaks. A witness, or a lawyer, or a 
judge, or a juror, whenever he opens his lips to speak, will meet M'Cafferty's 
eyes. Yet I see,</p>

<p class="MsoBodyText">as he sits there, that it is no anxiety that moves him to 
do this. He is a soldier, although he wears no uniform, and has the soldier's 
habit of looking at his interrogator steadily. He is a man of iron will.&quot;</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">The principal evidence is that of Corydon; it is a 
continuation of that given on Bourke's trial, and is as follows:</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">The informer, Corydon, was next examined by the 
Attorney-General. He repeated the evidence already recorded, and continued: </p>
<p class="MsoBodyText" style="margin-left: .5in">I know John M'Cafferty; that is 
he in the dock; I saw him first, in Dublin, in February, 1866; he was introduced 
to all the American officers there in Carey's hotel; it was the headquarters of 
all the American officers in Dublin at that time; he was introduced to me as 
Captain M'Cafferty, of the rebel army, who had served in Morgan's guerrillas; no 
statement was then made to me as to his being a member of the Fenian 
Brotherhood; all I knew at that meeting were Fenians; I saw, in Dublin, Captain 
Doheny, General Halpin, Colonel Kelly; I met a person named John Flood very 
often at Fenian meetings, in Dublin; I met Edward Duffy there; he was organizer 
for the province of Connaught; I met Captain Dunne at these meetings; I met a 
person named O'Connor there; I also met Dennis Burke at these meetings; I 
remained in Liverpool till February, 1867, employed in Fenian business; I 
received pay, while there, out of the Fenian funds, from Captain O'Rorke; he 
went by the name of Beecher; I saw M'Cafferty in February, 1867, in Liverpool ; 
Colonel Thomas Bourke, J. J. Rogers, Colonel Dunne, and others were with him ; I 
first saw him in Birchfield street, in Liverpool; that was a headquarters of the 
Fenian Brotherhood; the meeting on that occasion, stated that Stephens did not 
mean to fight, and they would not put up with his nonsense any longer, since he 
did not mean it; M'Cafferty was at that meeting, and could hear these words; 
M'Cafferty went somewhere between January and February; I don't know where; a 
meeting was held late in January, in Liverpool, about forming direc-</p>

Flood were present; Captain O'Rorke presided at it; the meeting came to the 
understanding that Stephens did not intend to fight at all; O'Rorke stated that 
now they had, therefore, formed a directory, which was to depose Stephens and 
constitute themselves as the authority of the Irish Republic ; he further stated 
that the Head Centre in England (Flood) had joined this directory, as well as 
Captain M'Cafferty and himself, and wanted also to know if the American officers 
then in Liverpool, would sanction Flood's name and M'Cafferty's name as members 
of the directory; the meeting agreed to have Flood and M'Cafferty on the 
directory; I saw the prisoner after that, in Liverpool, from the 11th to the 
19th February; there was a meeting of Fenians; M'Cafferty and Flood attended; 
they said they came from London, representing the directory; that they had 
brought about twenty pounds to be divided among the officers there, to pay their 
way to Chester; they stated that at Chester the castle was to be seized, the 
arms therein to be taken and put into trains, the rails were to be destroyed 
after the trains had started, the telegraph wires to be torn ; they were to go 
to Holyhead, seize mail steamer, and go thence to Ireland; the way Captain 
M'Cafferty stated these plans to the meeting, in company with Flood, was—the 
night of the following Monday was fixed upon to carry out the plan, all the 
American officers</p>

Chester, as well as the Centres in Liverpool; a Centre is a colonel; he has got

Ireland, and wait there for the final instructions as to the rising in Ireland; 
I did not see M'Cafferty again till I saw him in prison at Kilmainham; about a 
week before the rising, I attended a meeting held near the canal, in a small 
street off Brunswick street, in Dublin, at which it was announced the rising 
would take place on the 5th; I got instructions to go to Millstreet, in the 
county Cork, and see the Centre of that district; that was about the 25th 
February.</p>

<p class="MsoBodyText" style="margin-left: .5in">Examination resumed —At the

O'Brien, Colonel Dunne, Kirwan, James Smith, David Joyce and Dennis Burke; the 
only member of the Directory present was O'Rorke, who paid each officer present 
thirty shillings, to keep him till the rising took place; O'Rorke also stated 
there would be French and German officers to head the rising in Ireland; he did 
not say what the movements would be; we were to receive instructions, O'Rorke 
said, when we got to Dublin; he did not say from whom, but said they were in

considers an act of virtue. He is not believed; and when Mr. Dowse 
cross-examines him, he is made to feel that. He asks him questions, under which 
he winces and writhes, but in vain. He pins his shame to him in his despite, and 
makes even the hardened informer blush. There is, however, a variation in the 
scene. There is an argument about a law point, and Mr. Dowse disputes with the 
Attorney-General. The Attorney-General finds fault with Mr. Dowse's manner, and 
Mr. Dowse retorts that he is not to be taught manners by the Attorney-General, 
that he is as good and stands as high as he does, though he has not the harness 
of Government on his back. The Attorney-General subsides, and is decidedly and 
unmistakably snubbed.&quot;</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">In his address to the jury, Mr. Butt alluded to his 
client as &quot;a man who had won an honorable character on fields of fame, and who 
had only done what Englishmen gloried in, when they went to fight with 
Garibaldi,&quot; and held that there were no two witnesses to prove the only act of 
treason which affected him, as the informer's statement was not corroborated. At 
the conclusion of Mr. Butt's address, Judge Fitzgerald said:</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">John M'Cafferty, I have to apprise you that now, after 
your counsel has spoken, you are entitled—the law also gives you the privilege, 
of addressing the jury; and if you have anything to say to the jury, this is the 
proper time to make it.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">Captain M'Cafferty said: I have but one statement to 
make, and previous to making that statement, I feel bound, by private feelings, 
to return my deep, and bounden, and sincere thanks, and to both of them I do so, 
to Mr. Butt, whom I consider the star of the Irish</p>

<p class="MsoBodyText">bar, and to the noble and gallant Mr. Dowse. [Turning to 
Messrs. Butt and Dowse] he said: Gentlemen, to each of you I tender my sincere 
thanks. [Then, turning to the jury,] he said: Gentlemen, I have only this 
statement to make to this jury. I am a stranger. Unfortunately, I have been 
tried in this country by you on the charge of treason-felony against the 
Government of Great Britain. I was acquitted by the judges who presided at that 
tribunal, after the evidence had failed against me, on the part of the Crown 
prosecutor. They discharged me, without allowing my case to go to the jury, on 
that occasion. I pleaded, and properly pleaded, not guilty to the charge brought 
against me. That was the truth. I had committed no overt act of treason within 
the realm and jurisdiction of Great Britain. I returned to my native country 
after my acquittal. I again returned within the realm and jurisdiction of Great 
Britain. I have been led to believe—and I make the statement, emanating from my 
conscience—I have been led to believe, that from the moment of my arrest, the 
Government of Great Britain did not intend to deal fairly with me. I do not make 
this statement for the purpose of gaining sympathy.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">Mr. Butt, Q. C.—You had better not state that. You have 
paid me a compliment, and I would ask you not to say that.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">M'Cafferty—I have been led to believe it.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">Judge Fitzgerald—You had better be guided by your counsel 
in any observations upon this case as it now stands.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">Mr. Butt—I really and sincerely hope that Captain 
M'Cafferty will not use any strong language against the Government ; he has paid 
me a compliment, and I would ask him, as a favor, to make no attack upon the 
Government, or anything remarkable.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">M'Cafferty—I beg to explain. You have misunderstood me, 
in the manner in which I mean to bring this forward. I do not wish to make any 
attack upon the honor and integrity of the Government.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">Chief Justice—If you have anything to say in the case, we 
will hear you, but this is a general discursive statement. You had better 
confine yourself to observations upon the case.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">After consulting with Mr. Lawless for a few moments, 
M'Cafferty, addressing the jury, said : I have merely to say that I am inno-</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText"><b>190&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; CAPTAIN JOHN M'CAFFERTY</b>.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">cent—that I have not committed any overt act, with which 
I am charged, within the realm or jurisdiction of Great Britain. Mr. Butt—That 
is quite right.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">On Monday, May 6th, the jury returned a verdict of 
guilty, on all the counts. Sehtence was postponed for several days, to hear 
argument before the Court of Criminal Appeals, on points raised by Mr. Butt, who 
declared that in the whole range of state trials, perhaps there was not a single 
case which involved, he would not say so many intricate questions, but questions 
going so directly to the root of the law of high treason. It was, however, of no 
avail. On the 20th of May, Captain M'Cafferty was brought into Court, and being 
asked what he had to say why judgment of death should not be passed upon him, in 
a clear, unhesitating voice, he said :</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">&quot;My Lords, I have nothing to say that can, at this 
advanced stage of this trial, ward off that sentence of death. I might as well 
hurl my complaint, if I have one, at the orange trees of the sunny South, or the 
lofty pine of the great North, as now to speak to the question why sentence 
should not be passed upon me, according to the law of the day ; but I do 
protest, loudly, against the injustice of that sentence. I have been brought to 
trial upon a charge of high treason against the Government of Great Britain, and 
guilt has been brought home to me, on the evidence of one witness, and that 
witness a perjured informer. I deny, distinctly, that there have been two 
witnesses to prove the overt act of treason against me. I deny, distinctly, that 
you have brought two independent witnesses to two overt acts. There is but one 
witness to prove the overt act of treason against me. I grant, and freely grant, 
that there has been a cloud of circumstantial evidence, to show my connection, 
if I may please to use that word, with the Irish people, in their attempt for 
Irish independence, and I claim that, as an Ameri-</p>

<p class="MsoBodyText">can, and as an alien, I have a right to sympathize with 
the Irish people, or with any other people who may please to revolt against that 
form of government by which they believe they are tyrannically treated. England 
sympathized with America. She not only sympathized with her, but gave support to 
both parties. Who ever heard of Englishmen being arrested by the United States 
Government, for taking up arms on behalf of the confederation of the Southern 
States, or of being placed upon his trial on a charge of high treason against 
the Government I No such case ever appeared.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">&quot;I do not deny but that I have sympathized with the Irish 
people. I loved Ireland, and I love the Irish people. If I were free to-morrow, 
and the Irish people were to take the field for independence, my sympathies 
would be with them. I would join them, if they had any show whatever to win that 
independence, while I would not give my sanction to the useless effusion of 
blood. I have done it, and I state distinctly, that I have no connection 
whatever, directly or indirectly, with the movement that took place in the 
county of Dublin. I make that statement on the brink of my grave. Again, I claim 
that I have a right to be discharged on the charge that has been brought against 
me, by the nature of the law by which I have been tried. That law distinctly 
says that you must produce two independent witnesses to prove the overt act of 
treason against the prisoner. I claim, and claim loudly, that you have not 
produced, according to that law, these two independent witnesses. This is the 
only complaint I have to make. I make that loudly. I find no fault with the 
jury. I have no complaint to make against the judge. I have been tried and found 
guilty, and I am perfectly satisfied' I will go to my grave. I will go to my 
grave as a gentleman and a Christian. Although I regret that I should be cut off 
at this state of life, still many noble and generous Irishmen fell on behalf of 
my Southern land. I do not wish to make any flowery speech in this court of 
justice; and whhout any further remarks, I will now accept the sentence of the 
court.&quot;</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">The death sentence was then pronounced by Judge 
Fitzgerald, after which the prisoner, &quot; still unshaken,&quot; spoke as follows:</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText"><b>192&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; CAPTAIN JOHN M'CAFFERTY.</b></p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">&quot;I will accept my sentence as a gentleman and a 
Christian, and I have but one request, and that is, after the execution of the 
sentence, my remains may be turned over to Mr. Lawless, to be interred by him in 
consecrated ground, as quietly as he possible can. I have now to return my 
grateful and sincere thanks to Mr. Butt, the star of the Irish bar, for his able 
defence of the alien prisoners. [To Mr. Butt]—Mr. Butt, I return you my thanks. 
I also return the same token of esteem to Mr. Dowse, for the kind manner in 
which he speaks of my former life. Those allusions recalled to my mind many 
moments, some bright, beautiful, glorious, and yet some sad recollections 
drifted before my eyes, of that gleam of hope that floated for an instant in the 
revolutionary struggle, and then sank forever. Mr. Butt, please give to Mr. 
Dowse my grateful and sincere thanks. Mr. Lawless, to you I return my thanks now 
for your many kindnesses, and I can do no more.&quot;</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">Mr. Lawless then shook hands with the prisoner, who 
immediately retired with a firm step.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">The gentleman who visited Colonel Bourke in his cell, 
caught a glimpse of his fellow prisoner, himself unseen, and thus relates it :</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">&quot;When I entered the prison I was shown along through many 
corridors, to that recent building called the New Jail. The door was opened upon 
a passage, lofty and airy, in which my view was bounded by a screen, but whose 
hue was, to my eyes, of ebon darkness. I passed beyond it, and a cell door met 
my glance on the side of the passage, in the centre of which was a small 
trap-door, of about one foot square, through which I looked, and saw Captain 
John M'Cafferty, dressed as I last caught his glance, with stalwart form as 
ever, but now kneeling, with his arms outstretched, and his hands clasped 
beneath, his face bent upon them, in prayer. Before his humbled brow rose an 
image the most sacred to Catholic eyes, the most hopeful to Christian hope. It 
was the image of the Crucified. The lofty brow of the great Sufferer was crowned 
with</p>

<p class="MsoBodyText">the diadem of agony. The artist had pictured the drops of 
blood that oozed from the gashed forehead, the heavy gouts of gore that fell 
from the hand and foot and side, and the whole eidolon an awful representation 
of the sacrifice of Calvary. I looked and listened—the supplicant still 
unconscious of human presence. Low murmurs reached my ear. They were murmurs of 
prayer and pardon—the prayer of a man about to die with the spirit of a 
Christian gentleman.' Why should I intrude upon its rapture, its faith and 
consolation.&quot;</p>
<span style="font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: Times New Roman">In June, Captain 
M'Cafferty's sentence was commuted to penal servitude for life. The prisoner 
received the news with composure, and was removed under a strong escort to the 
Mountjoy penal depot.</span></body></html>
