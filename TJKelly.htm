<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;COLONEL THOMAS JAMES* KELLY, whose name is so

after the retirement of Stephens is a man of marked ability, various resources
and untiring energy ; a clear thinker, and a sagacious worker, he has also
displayed a very remarkable adroitness in his movements in England and Ireland.
While managing the details of the organization, he has baffled the watchfulness
of the authorities, and even when his residence was betrayed to the Government,
he managed by that restless foresight which amounts to intuition, to change his
whereabouts and to evade up to the present the attentions of the police. The
dangers through which he passed in America, as an officer in the signal service
during the war, concentrated the self-reliance which has been of such use to him
in the service of Ireland. A follower of the art preservative of all arts, the

<p class="Style4" style="margin-left:.05in;text-indent:.1in;line-height:normal"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">Thomas
J. Kelly was born in Mount Bellew, comity Galway, in 1833. His father belonged
to the farm­ing class and brought up his son for the Church. On this account he
received a better education than is generally the lot of young men in similar
circum­stances. Not Laving a vocation for the clerical profession, his father
wisely bound him to the printing business in Loughrea. Finding the prospects
before him too circumscribed for his aspiring mind, young Kelly started for
America, and arrived in New York when but eighteen years of age. Like most young
men on their first arrival here, he had to encounter those buffetings which
almost invariably fall to the lot of the inexperienced in a new country ; but
with his usual persevering industry, he overcame them, and got good employment
at his profession as printer. He soon rose in the estimation of his employers
and in the good opinion of his brother craftsmen, among whom he was quickly
distinguished for his integrity and ability. He was a prominent and active
member of the Printer's Union, and members of the craft now refer to him as
another evidence of the ability which distinguish Printers when they enter
public life. The eminence to which the followers of Guttenberg and Faust, of
Etienne, and Caxton, have arisen, is a favor­ite and prolific theme with the
crafts-brethren. This is not to be wondered at, or checked, when we consider the
philosophers, poets and historians, on the muster<o:p>

graduating from the composing stick to the baton of France, distinguished
himself by driving <span style="letter-spacing:-.1pt">the English and Russians
from Holland, and against the</span> Austrians on the plains of Italy. Truly may
the printers be proud of the men who have done honor to the profession, and it
was extremely pleasing in this connection to hear some of the craft refer to
Kelly, as one who illustrated the force </span><i><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt;

<p class="Style4" style="line-height:normal"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
11.0pt">On his arrival in New York, young Kelly, having a predisposition for
military matters from boyhood, was delighted with the advantages offered by the
National Guard, and companies of citizen soldiery. He of course joined a
military organization, and in time identified himself with every movement
tending to exalt his countrymen in the social and moral scale. The moment a true
young Irishman gets a weapon into his hand, his first thought is for Ireland,
and the more he learns the use of it, the more intense is his desire to use it
against England. Kelly had this natural feeling, and became an active member of
the Irish Society which had produced the Fenian Brotherhood-. that known by the
significant title of &quot; The Emmet Monument Association.&quot;<o:p>

11.0pt">Mr. Kelly continued to be a warm and fearless supporter of the Union
cause, and when the rebellion broke out he was obliged to leave. These were the
terrible days when terrorism ruled in Tennessee, and when the Legislature in
secret session, and without waiting for the people to vote on the question of
seces­sion, placed the power of the State at the disposal of the &quot;Southern
Confederacy.&quot; By the machinery of mobs and vigilance committees dextrously
worked, night and day, thousands of Union men were forced to <i><span style="letter-spacing:.2pt">fly
</span></i>from the State. &quot; We have seen scores of the best men of
Tennessee,&quot; said a competent authority, writing at the time, &quot;within
the last few days, and they all bear witness that in their belief, the reign of
terror now raging and maddening in that State, has had no parallel in modern
history. There is less of personal freedom, there is more of atrocious and horri­ble
tyranny in Tennessee at this time, than would be found under the worst and most
wretched government of Asia, or the savage islands of the sea.&quot; At this
time, Kelly was the last man to fly the starry flag in Nashville, over his
printing office, and he had to <i><span style="letter-spacing:.2pt">fly </span></i>so
precipitately that he was unable to save his proper­ty, and therefore was again
thrown on the world with nothing but his own strong will and industrious
perseverance to rely upon. But he was not disheart­ened. He saw that a great
war was in its inception, and that patriotism should meet its just reward. His<o:p>

of the Union, and calling for</span> recruits, reached him, and he started with
the inten­tion of going to New York and joining it. When he arrived at
Cincinnati, he heard of the enrollment of the 10th Ohio, an Irish regiment, and
immediately joined its ranks as a private, and at the expiration of the three
months' service, he re-enlisted for the war.<o:p>

able to return to his <span style="letter-spacing:-.1pt">regiment he was
selected for duty as Signal Officer on</span> General Thomas' staff, with rank
of Captain, a distinc­<span style="letter-spacing:-.1pt">tion which speaks for

<p class="Style4" style="margin-right:.05in;line-height:normal"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">The
signal service was one of great importance, and imminent danger. From the nature
of its proceedings little publicity was given to them. Tact, sagacity, quick
perception, and persistency under all obstacles, were the requisites to make or
distinguish an officer in this service. Oftentimes the signal officers, accom­panied
only by a few men, had to occupy a prominent isolated position on a mountain or
hill, to telegraph their signals or respond to others. These positions <span style="letter-spacing:

often overpowered or killed.<o:p>

Kelly discharged the duties of his position to the entire satisfaction of
General Thomas, who complimented him for his ability and zeal. In camp he was a
great favorite with his brother officers, on account of his agreeable manner, in
their social hours, and his daring disposition in times of danger, made him
relied on by the men. His regiment was finally mustered out of the service,
having served its time honorably.<o:p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:.15in"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">About
this time when he had helped to save the Republic of his adoption, circumstances
led him to place his experience in the cause which designed to make a republic
in his native land. By so doing he doubtless interfered materially with his
future pros­pects, as he was offered promotion in the American service, and
declined it to further the cause of Irish liberty. Being present at the Chicago
Fair, to raise funds in aid of the Irish movement, he received much information
concerning the progress of republican ideas in Ireland, and the desire of the
Fenian Broth­erhood there to take the field. He was so much <span style="letter-spacing:-.1pt">impressed
with what he heard, and believing he would</span> be of positive benefit from
the training he had under-<span style="letter-spacing:-.1pt">gone, he made up

himself and his expe­rience at the disposal of the Brotherhood.<o:p>

Accredited to Mr. Stephens, the inter-view had a special influence on the future
of both. They were immediately struck with each other. Kelly beheld an untiring,
restless conspirator, with capacity to sway men's minds, in Stephens; Stephens <span style="letter-spacing:-.1pt">acknowledged
the blunt, honest and capable soldier, in</span> Kelly. Becoming convinced of
the power and influ­ence of James Stephens, and finding him master of the
occasion, Kelly became his devoted adherent. He was at once set to work, and
deputed to make an inspection of the state of things in Ireland, and report on
them on his return. His report was fully satisfactory. He stated that he was
amazed at the ramifications of the Brotherhood in Ireland, and could <span style="letter-spacing:-.1pt">not

What has that in common with the programme of John Bright? Not even universal
suffrage, which he is against. <b>Why </b>then, should you fasten us to the
skirts of one man? We are a people and a principle—that is to say, the eternal
and the absolute. Can a principle be vanquished? Why, therefore do you say we
are vanquished? Did not Christianity commence by defeats ? Did it not, like us,
water the ground with the blood of its martyrs. Ours yield in nothing to those
of the primitive ages, and if their voices, stifled in the dungeons of England,
could come here to protest against your strange advice, and your still stranger
criticisms, not one would use any other language than that which I use to you at
this moment in their name and in the name of all proletarian Ireland. Our

another nation. The insurrection, or rather </span><span style="font-size:10.0pt;
