                <p align="left"><b>Rand Bitter is a scholar who 
                  researched Robert Minty's Cavalry Brigade and brought together almost everything 
                  known of Minty, his family, the cavalry and his life after the war into a book: 
  &quot;Minty and The Cavalry&quot;. The book is self-published and consists of 580 pages with copious footnotes and excerpts from 
                  brigade histories and Official Records correspondence, newspaper articles by Minty and his men 
                  and diaries by soldiers who fought with him. If I was only able to read only one book 
                  on Minty and his Sabre Brigade this is the one I would choose.&nbsp;
