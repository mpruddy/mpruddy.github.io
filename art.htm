            <p align="left"><span style="font-size:14.0pt"><b>Hugh Arthur Ruddy</b></span><b>
            was born April 14, 1903 in Chicago Illinois to&nbsp; first
            generation Irish immigrant parents, James Ruddy and Annie (McNulty) Ruddy. James was a foreman at the Illinois Steel Company.
            Hugh Arthur was the
            youngest preceded by two brothers, Howard and Francis and a sister,
            Alice. He was             baptized on April 26, 1903 St Bride’s Roman Catholic Church. Tragedy struck when he was but
            eight months old when his father James died in Chicago on January 7,
            1904 leaving Annie and her four children alone in a big city. James'
            older brother Mike, who owned the family farm in Fairfax, Minnesota,
            went immediately to Chicago and brought James' body along with Annie and the children back to Fairfax.
            James is interred in the family plot at St Andrew's Cemetery. Annie and her children moved into a modest house in Fairfax. Before 1910, Annie&nbsp;dropped &quot;Hugh&quot; from his name in favor of
            &quot;Arthur H.&quot; Arthur was given first
            communion at St Andrew’s church in Fairfax on June 8, 1913. Arthur
            was called upon during the summers as he grew older to work on his
            uncle Mike's farm. Sometime before 1920, Annie moved her children to
            Minneapolis and opened a boarding house which supplied her and the
            children a living. Athur married Elisabeth Palmer August 20.1933 in Rochester, NY. Arthur and Elisabeth had three sons Michael, James and Samuel. Arthur died April 2, 1987 in Cardif, California&nbsp;and is buried in Oceanside, California.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</b></p>

            access to a higher education. Arthur, perhaps as the youngest, was
            chosen to go to college by Annie and entered the Universtiy of
            Minnesota's school of Architecture in 1920. During the summers
            between semesters Arthur would work in the National Park system.
            There are pictures from family albums showing him at Yellowstone and
            at Glacier National Park. He graduated from the University of
            Minnesota with a Bachelor of Arts in Architecture. Arthur was the

          <p align="left"><b>Arthur's first real job came in 1926 when he joined
          the Chicagoan Magazine as Art Editor. Between 1926 and 1927 Arthur
          painted 12 covers for the Chicagoan Magazine according to art
          historian Neil Harris who wrote &quot;The Chicagoan&quot; a book
          detailing the history of that magazine. Harris characterizes Arthur's
          art as &quot;whimsical, light-spirited, and witty -- playful in a
          1920s mode.&quot; Arthur also did considerable interior work in the
          magazine producing cartoons and illustrating articles.</b></p>
            <p align="left"><b>Arthur once told us he had dated the actress Ann Southern when
            she was a chorus girl in Chicago. Whether true or not I can
            not say. Research reveals that Ann Sothern (Harriette A Lake) moved from North Dakota to 
			Minneapolis in 1911. Harriette Lake graduated from Minneapolis Central
            High in 1926 very active in singing and placing both together in 
			Minneapolis before Arthur left for Chicago. Sothern's biographer, 
			Margie Shultz, does not mention anywhere that Sothern lived in 
			Chicago where that supposed date took place; but, A Chicago Company 
			produced a Broadway show in New York in New York in 1933 with 
			Harriette Lake in a leading role. So nothing negates his claim. Both
            of them have passed on so the mystery remains.</b></p>

            Arthur's wife, about Arthur's time in New York indicate him living
            in a studio apartment with a job designing lighting fixtures while
            in his spare time he painted city scenes and rural landscapes.
            Apparently Arthur and Elisabeth spent a lot of time in Greenwich Village, NY and were acquainted with the many artists and
            sculpturers who were hoping to be recognized in that New York art
          community in the 1930s. Arthur
            exhibited his paintings at several Art Galleries in New York but
            whether any were ever sold or not I do not know. Arthur and
            Elisabeth married in 1933 and then in 1938 reality hit home as
            Elisabeth became pregnant and quit her job at Crowell publishing
            where she was a sub-editor on the Woman's Home Companion. On August
            6, 1938 she presented Arthur with Michael, the first of their three sons. Arthur had found a job at the New
            York's World's Fair of 1939 - 1940 where his lighting fixtures were
            found along the fair's sidewalks, and he was designated Artist and Director
            of the fireworks and fountain display that took place at night. He
          also designed metal plaques of animals that were used as signposts at
          the Bronx Zoo.</b></font></p>
