			<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">&nbsp;</p>
			<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify"><font size="4">In 
			May, '63, one thing and another put into my head the notion that I 
			would come out to America and see what kind of country it was and 
			what kind of people lived in it. I told James Stephens should have 
			to do it, and he wrote me a letter expressing his regret. Edward 
			O'Sullivan, a butter merchant, of Cork, a '48 man and a great friend 
			of mine, got me letters of introduction from John B. Dillon and John 
			Edward Pigott to Richard O'Gorman, Robert E. Kelly and others in New 
			York.</font></p>
			<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify"><font size="4">I 
			put my business and political affairs at home in the best order I 
			could, and sailed from the cove of Cork in the steamship City of 
			Baltimore. In thirteen days' time I was in New York. Some natural 
			impulse of mine was very near getting me into trouble the hour I 
			landed. I was walking from the Battery to John O'Mahoney's office, 
			and there at Park Row were little groups of people looking at the 
			soldiers and the soldiers' tents that were in the park where the 
			Post Office stands now. A policeman addressing a man very near me 
			said, &quot;Get away out of this.&quot; and suiting his action to his words 
			gave him a clout of his club on the thigh. I thought it a most 
			outrageous thing to do, and my impulse was to remonstrate with the 
			policeman; did I do so it is very probable the club would be used on 
			me also. Policemen in Ireland have license to do what they like when 
			they are playing politics with the people, but on patrol street duty 
			they are not permitted to use their clubs upon men unless in self 
			defense, or threatened with assault. They can arrest a man for 
			obstructing the public pathway and take him to the lockup or to the 
			magistrate, but to club him out of the way is not allowed. I spent 
			parts of my lifetime in the English prisons. I was subjected to ill 
			treatment of every kind, I was knocked down, half strangled, kicked 
			and cuffed and leaped upon by jailors, but I felt more humiliated at 
			being taken to the station house from my house in New York one night 
			than I did at all that England put me through. It was the time I 
			kept hotel in Chatham square, Now York. It was one of those times 
			the police were ordered to make raids on the liquor dealers. In my 
			own house I was made a prisoner of. There was no warrant of law to 
			take me from my home to a prison. As soon as I got into the 
			legislature I'll take very good care that a law will be passed to 
			abolish such a practice of arrest as that—a practice no way in 
			keeping with the character of a noble land and a liberty loving 
			people.</font></p>
			<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify"><font size="4">My 
			speaking this way may be considered a digression from the subject of 
			the Fenian movement, but it is no digression. Half the liquor 
			dealers of Brooklyn are Irish, and half of them are Fenians, and the 
			whole of them as well as the whole of the readers of the EAGLE are 
			interested in everything that concerns the liberty of the American 
			citizen.</font></p>
			<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify"><font size="4">When 
			I landed in New York that May day 1863, the first I looked for was 
			John O'Mahoney. He was attending a drill in some armory near 
			Fourteenth street, and to the armory I went. I met him and made an 
			appointment to meet him at No. 6 Center street next day. I remained 
			twelve weeks in New York that time, and an exciting time it was. I 
			became acquainted with numbers of army officers who were home on 
			furlough—many of whom I afterward met in Ireland in 1865, many more 
			of whom went into the war in America again and never came back any 
			more. God be good to them and us all! I have reason to pray for some 
			of those who are gone; the two brothers I had went into the war and 
			they are dead; the only sister I had—her husband went into the war 
			and she is a widow.</font></p>
			<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify"><font size="4">It 
			is twenty-two years this very month of July since some things passed 
			before my eyes in connection with Feniansim and in connection with 
			American liberty, and those things are as clear before me today as 
			they were then, I will speak of a few of them, They may be found as 
			interesting reading as anything else I can write in connection with 
			my knowledge of the Fenian movement.</font></p>
			<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify"><font size="4">One 
			of the noblest, men I knew in connection with that movement was 
			Michael O'Brien, who was hanged in Manchester. He was one of the 
			first men initiated into it in the City of Cork, where I often met 
			him during the progress of the work in its early clays. He had been 
			in America some months before I came, and during these months he had 
			been out to the army to see some soldiers who had boon comrades of 
			his at home. Captain Denis Downing, who lost a leg at Gettysburg, 
			and he had been bedfellows a few years before, when they wore 
			salesmen at Arnott’s establishment in Cork. Denis was going into a 
			fight one of the days Mike O'Brien was in the camp, and Mike as a 
			volunteer went into the fight with him. He was telling me this one 
			day in New York, and after telling it to me he said:</font></p>
			<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify"><font size="4">
			“Now, Rossa, I have made up my mind to join the army, and wily I 
			called on you to-day is to ask you to come over with me to Jersey 
			and see me off.&quot;</font></p>
			<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify"><font size="4">
			&quot;Now, Mike, give up your joking with me; the day is too hot and I'm 
			in no good humor.&quot; &quot;Rossa, I'm not joking at all. I have made up my 
			mind, and you'll have to come with me; put on your coat.&quot;</font></p>
			<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify"><font size="4">
			&quot;Mike! aren't you sworn to fight for Ireland? How can you fight for 
			Ireland if you're killed here?&quot; &quot;What good am I for Ireland if I 
			don't know how to fight? I am not afraid of being killed, and after 
			having some experience of fighting here, I'll be twice better able 
			to fight at home.&quot;</font></p>
			<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify"><font size="4">He 
			had made up his mind to join the army: there was no use in my trying 
			to dissuade him from doing so. I went with him and we crossed the 
			Cortlandt street Ferry. In Jersey City we went into a recruiting 
			office, and there I saw Mike O'Brien sworn in a soldier of the 
			United States army. One of the recruiting officers in the office 
			tried to induce me to list—complimenting me by saying I would make a 
			splendid looking soldier, but I had cares upon me that did not leave 
			me free to go with my comrade. I had a family over in Ireland. I 
			remained with Mike O'Brien that day till he was going off with other 
			recruits to the camp; he got on board the car that started from the 
			archway there near Taylor's Hotel, and I never now stand by that 
			archway that I do not look up the street and see Mike O'Brien on the 
			back platform of the car waving his hat to me. That was the last 
			sight I had of him. Four years after that day I was in Millbank 
			Prison in the heart of the City of London; I was in solitary 
			confinement, that is, in a prison within prison—a blacker hell In 
			hell. I jumped up to one of the bars of the window grating and 
			through the air hole I asked was any one in the cell over me or 
			under me. I was answered by a man who gave his name as William 
			Murphy, of Manchester, who met me at the Hop Pole Inn in '65. I 
			remembered him. I asked him what in creation brought him next door 
			to me, and there and then I learned of the Manchester rescue and of 
			the hanging of Allen, Larkin and O'Brien. &quot;You knew O'Brien?&quot; said 
			he. &quot;What O'Brien was he?&quot; said I. &quot;Why. Mike O'Brien, that was at 
			Arnott's in Cork, and that you were with in America when he joined 
			the American army.&quot;</font></p>
			<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify"><font size="4">I 
			was hanging to one of the bars of the window, but I didn't hang any 
			longer. When. I heard that news I fell to the ground. Poor Murphy 
			himself fell a victim to English &quot;justice:&quot; the treatment he 
			received in prison sent him to an early grave.</font></p>
			<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify"><font size="4">I 
			was in Now York the days men were drafted for the army, and I was 
			uptown one of those days and saw some of the draft riots. Before I 
			conclude the writing I am engaged in, It is expected I will write 
			down what are the causes of the temporary collapse of the Fenian 
			movement, and it seems to me I see one of the causes in the fact 
			that Ireland has no power to enforce a draft, no power to make 
			Irishmen fight for their country. There are a lot of men who will 
			talk for it; Big patriots too. So there were in New York in the 
			clays of June and July, 1863, a lot of patriots who would talk for 
			the Union, but they would not volunteer to fight for it. Lincoln saw 
			that talking soldiers were no good, that it was fighting soldiers he 
			wanted, and he compelled some of the talkers to go to the front and 
			fight. When they were in the fight, when they saw there was no help 
			for it but to fight, they fought well. If Ireland had a draft law 
			that would make all her talking patriots fight, Ireland would not be 
			an enslaved land to-day; or if she had a law that would make all the 
			Fenians stand to their pledges and their principles, there would not 
			be so many deserters from Fenianism as there have been—so many who 
			swore to obtain freedom by fight, giving up the idea of fight and 
			joining in with the crowd who go in for obtaining freedom by talk. 
			Ireland has no law, no power to enforce a draft upon her sons and 
			make them fight for the freedom of their land. That is one of the 
			causes of the temporary collapse of Fenianism. The men who would 
			free the country by talk grew stronger than the men who would free 
			it by fight—they are stronger to-day.</font></p>
			<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify"><font size="4">
			Passing that matter by till I approach the end of my journey, I 
			must, before I take myself back to Ireland, tell a story of one 
			day's experience of being on the Fenian mission with John O'Mahoney 
			in America. He told me he had made an engagement for us to visit 
			General Thomas Francis Meagher at his father in law's place in the 
			Orange Mountains of New Jersey, and the night of the day of that 
			visit to Jersey we were to be back in New York under engagement to 
			meet General Michael Corcoran. Early one morning we crossed the 
			river to Jersey, or maybe to Hoboken, and at the railroad depot we 
			met Captain Jack Gosson, who was also going out to General 
			Meagher's. Captain Jack was a smart, sprightly looking man that day; 
			he was in uniform and as nice looking a soldier as you could set 
			eyes on. When we arrived at our destination General Meagher was at 
			the depot with a wagon and pair of horses. We got in and he drove us 
			to the mansion—a distance of a few miles. All the way, and all day 
			in fact, he kept asking me questions about Ireland, the spirit of 
			the people there, their hopes and their prospects. The Captain and 
			he talked occasionally of many droll things that happened in camp, 
			in field and in fight, and they laughed heartily over them. We were 
			introduced to Mrs. Meagher, to her father and mother, Mr. and Mrs. 
			Townsend. After lunch O’Mahoney told me aside he was going to have a 
			few minutes' private talk with Meagher, and I walked into the 
			orchard by the side of the house. In about half an hour they walked 
			into the orchard and found me admiring a tree of blackberries. I 
			never saw blackberries grow on a tree before; I never saw them grow 
			in a trained, civilized manner before; all the blackberries I know 
			in my blackberry days grew wild and no one owned them but those who 
			picked them off the wild briars and bushes. Meagher found me 
			looking, with surprise, I suppose, at a blackberry laden tree, and 
			he went around and around it, picking off the biggest guboluchs he 
			could got and handing them to me; some of them were nearly as large 
			as eggs. Then we strolled up the bank of a rivulet that flowed 
			through the wood. O'Mahoney told me he had made matters all right 
			with him—had initiated him a Fenian. I let them walk ahead of me so 
			as to give them an opportunity to talk alone. I sat by the hank of 
			the stream, it was a warm day, and when they were returning they 
			found me swimming in a large pool in a bosom of the little river. 
			They laughed and passed on, Meagher telling me not to delay long 
			after them, as dinner would be ready soon. I joined them at the 
			dinner table shortly after.</font></p>
			<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify"><font size="4">I 
			have heard many stories of Thomas Francis Meagher, but the 
			impression he made upon me that day throws the whole of them aside. 
			I can believe nothing of him but that he was a man every inch of 
			him, and a noble man at that. And corporeally, he was. I think, as 
			handsome a form of a man as man could see. His height, as I saw him 
			that day, might be about five feet eight; he wore a blue frock coat, 
			buttoned around the waist, though it was a hot Summer's day. There 
			were clam pagnes and wines and brandies at the table that day but he 
			drank none of them. O'Mahoney and he talked of the riots in New York 
			some days before that, and O’Mahoney said if he (Meagher) appeared 
			among the rioters his presence would appease them. You make a 
			mistake there,&quot; said Meagher. &quot;If I appeared among them it is more 
			likely they would seize me and tear me limb front limb, if they 
			could.&quot;</font></p>
			<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify"><font size="4">In 
			the evening he drove us to the railroad station. Mrs, Meagher 
			accompanied us. Captain Gosson went back with them.</font></p>
			<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify"><font size="4">As 
			soon as O’Mahoney and I reached New, York we went to General 
			Corcoran's; the house was full of guests and full of entertainment 
			for the guests. Song and speech and story were the order of the 
			evening; priests and doctors, civilians and soldiers were there in 
			good fellowship.</font></p>
			<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify"><font size="4">
			There was toasting of Ireland and of Old Ireland's cause, of 
			Fenianism and of freedom. General Corcoran was one of the leading 
			Fenians in the American army; fighting for his adopted land did not 
			hinder him from doing a soldier's part to obtain liberty for the 
			land of his birth.</font></p>

			Those days I spent in New York I met William O'Shea, my companion in 
			the dock and in the prison four years before. A carriage came to my 
			door in Madison street one day, and out of it came two soldiers 
			limping into the house. They wore the uniforms of captains of the 
			American army, but the uniforms were covered with dust and earth; 
			you would think the men had been rolling themselves in a newly 
			plowed field. Well, they had fallen on the field—the battlefield of 
			Gettysburg—and from that field they came direct to New York, taking 
			a carriage at the depot and calling to see me. I entered the 
			carriage with them. Fltzharris' family lived in Madison street and 
			we left him at home; lie was wounded in a couple of places. I met 
			him afterward in Ireland; he died in New York some years ago. 
			William O'Shea and I made some calls to see family friends of his; 
			he called at a bank and drew some money, and then went to a hospital 
			in Broadway. I sat by his bedside while the doctors dressed his 
			wounds. One bullet had entered his hand at the wrist and come out at 
			the elbow, another had entered his body in front under the ribs and 
			come out at the back; he was out of the hospital in a fortnight's 
			time and went to the war a fortnight afterward. He was killed on the 
			field of battle in the next fight. A bravo, daring Fenian man in 
			Ireland was William O'Shea, of Bantry; a brave, daring soldier in 
			America was Captain William O'Shea, of the Forty-second Tammany 
			Regiment.</font></p>
			<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify"><font size="4">
			During the fortnight that passed between his leaving the hospital 
			and going to the front he went to some battlefield where a brother 
			of his had been killed. He telegraphed to me that he was bringing on 
			the brother's remains to New York. I mot him at the Jersey City 
			Ferry and went with him to Calvary to lay the brother's remains in 
			the family grave. As we were returning from Calvary we met the 
			funeral of General Michael Corcoran's wife. We returned to Calvary 
			with it, and before I reached New York that night I had been 
			introduced to over a hundred Irishmen, officers in the American 
			army. Some of these went to Ireland afterward, more of them fell in 
			battle ere the cruel war was ended—nearly all of them are now dead.</font></p>
			<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify"><font size="4">I 
			was introduced to a host of army men one night in Riker's Island. 
			Colonel Downing was there on temporary duty, and before Mike O'Brien 
			'listed he and I got a pass one day from Colonel Nugent and went up 
			to the island. We slept in Colonel Downing's tent that night. While 
			in the tent a number of officers came into and around it, 
			complaining that an officer was arrested and put in the guard house; 
			they complained that the arrest was an arbitrary one, and proposed 
			they should go to the commanding officer and get the man out. 
			Colonel Downing disapproved of doing anything of the kind; that it 
			would be contrary to all discipline, and many went away dissatisfied 
			that he would not concur in the course they proposed to adopt. I 
			must have taken part in the conversation, some way, because after 
			the men went away the Colonel laughed heartily, remarking, &quot;Well, 
			Rossa, I was on thorns lest those men would find out you were not a 
			soldier, because they would be mad at any civilian interfering in a 
			military dispute.&quot;</font></p>
			<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify"><font size="4">
			Something happened in Ireland that suddenly called me home, and I 
			left New York for Ireland in August, '63. A few weeks after my 
			return James Stephens told me he intended starting a newspaper, and 
			he asked me to go up to Dublin to undertake the business management 
			of it. I went to Dublin,</font></p>
			<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify"><font size="4">and 
			the first number of the new paper— , the Irish People—appeared In 
			November. The name of Thomas Clarke Luby was registered; in the Four 
			Courts as the proprietor of the paper. John O'Leary was the editor, 
			the name of O'Donovan Rossa was registered as the responsible 
			publisher. That was a nail in my coffin two years after, when Judge 
			Keogh was dealing out English justice to us; he held me as 
			publisher, accountable for every anti English article that was 
			published in the paper. But come to that by and by.</font></p>
			<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify"><font size="4">Mr. 
			Stephens had much consultation with the prominent men of the 
			organization before he started this paper. The question was: Would 
			not a newspaper organ be injurious rather than serviceable to the 
			society; would it not be making public the existence of what ought 
			to be kept private? But there were so many newspapers now attacking 
			our work, so many peaceable and constitutional patriots publicly and 
			privately thwarting the spread of it, that it was considered 
			absolutely necessary to have an organ, even though there was danger 
			in having it. The O'Donoghue was the great &quot;heaven sent leader&quot; of 
			the day, as A. M. Sullivan used to call him in his Nation; he was 
			then about as parliamentarily popular as Parnell is now; he and 
			those who surrounded him wore leading men away from the true faith 
			—from the faith that it is in fight alone there is any chance for 
			freedom. “By the blows alone that men strike in their strength can 
			the chains of the tyrant be broken.”</font></p>
			<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify"><font size="4">Up 
			to this have I written my history of Fenianism from Skibbereen, and 
			very likely have necessarily made myself look as if I considered 
			Skibbereen the center of Ireland. But here now am I up in Dublin, 
			the center city of the earth, and as I radiate out from it during 
			the next few years—traveling England, Scotland and all Ireland 
			(except one county of it) in connection with spreading the 
			movement—I have room to show my readers that my head is broader than 
			they think.</font></p>
			<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify"><font size="4">
			Before I came to Dublin I had correspondence with several men whose 
			letters I used to see in the newspapers, and one by one I invited 
			these to Dublin and swore in the most of them. The first of them was 
			John Ryan, of Liverpool; he belonged to the St. Patrick's 
			Brotherhood in England. The first week I came to Dublin I invited 
			him to come across to see me to 12 Parliament street. He came and in 
			12 Parliament street I swore him In as a member of the Irish 
			Revolutionary Brotherhood. He carried the seed of salvation with him 
			to England, and was the first man to scatter it among the Irish 
			element there. Nobly and well he discharged the duty of his mission. 
			He was one of the twelve men selected to guard the escape of James 
			Stephens the night he was stolen out of Richmond Prison, Dublin. 
			John Ryan was a true, brave Irishman, though born in England. It is 
			only when good men are dead other men can afford to speak well of 
			them. John Ryan left no wife or children after him either, on whose 
			head England could wreak vengeance on account of what I now say of

			<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify"><font size="4">The 
			second man I swore in the first week I went to Dublin was Joseph P. 
			MacDonnell, one of the heads of Brotherhood of St. Patrick, in 
			Dublin. Mac was a good sturdy worker too, that is while he was in 
			Ireland; but he's dead now, he is in America, and doing nothing to 
			serve the cause he twenty-two years ago swore to me he would serve 
			during life; he is editor and proprietor of the Labor Standard, in 
			Patterson, N. J. He and I never had a falling out, we were always 
			friends, and I must do him the justice to say he was never afraid or 
			ashamed to own that he was once an Irishman and a member of the 
			Irish Revolutionary Brotherhood. But he's dead to Ireland at the 
			present day—like a good many more that will cross my path in America 
			while I am writing these letters.</font></p>
			<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify"><font size="4">And 
			why is it that Irishmen who were good men in Ireland grow dead to 
			Ireland in America; what is the cause of it? I have often asked 
			myself that question. I have often dwelt upon the subject of it. I 
			suppose the answer is in Nature; the old tree transplanted hardly 
			ever flourishes. The Irishman who was able to got on smoothly enough 
			on his native soil, able to live like his father and mother lived. 
			who had grown up with the natural hatred of England in his blood, 
			England's tyranny being ever before his eyes while ho was growing 
			up, found when he came to America that he had no home and no 
			friends—that he had to make a home for himself or perish; all the 
			associations of his life were cut oft from him; if be had a wife and 
			child they were tossed about, felt want perhaps. The man was 
			transplanted; torn up by the roots from his native soil, and left to 
			stand unsupported on a foreign soil; every wind that blew shook him, 
			and shook out of him whatever was in him of the sentiment and poetry 
			of patriotism and of life; he had to do what he never did before, 
			perhaps; he had to work hard to get as much money as would buy 
			bread, his hands blistered and his soul soured and he was no longer 
			the Irishman he was in Ireland.</font></p>
			<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify"><font size="4">Then 
			he saw what delusions were fostered under the name of Irish 
			patriotism in America; he saw every Irishman an Irish patriot; he 
			saw the men who would not come within a mile's screech of Fenianism 
			in Ireland screeching their life out in America to get recruits for 
			the Fenian movement; he saw the men of action at home dead and 
			lifeless in American life, and saw the men of tongue soaring to fame 
			on the wings of the wind or on the wings of the &quot;gas&quot; they 
			generated. he saw men who were hostile to Fenianism in Ireland 
			become leaders of patriotic Irish societies in America; I saw 
			William Everett, who was engaged by England in my prosecution in 
			Ireland in 1858 anti 1859—I saw him when I came out of prison to New 
			York, in 1871, the leading man, next to Richard B. Connolly, of the 
			St. Patrick's Alliance of America. William Everett is living to-day. 
			I am kind of friendly with him. It is not to injure him I speak. I 
			speak of him to illustrate my story. He was at the English side of 
			the house in Ireland; his patriotism was opposed to my patriotism. 
			He would perhaps be a good Irishman in Ireland, if Ireland had a 
			government of its own, but it is England has all the emoluments in 
			Ireland, and it is English politics pay there. There are emoluments 
			attached to Irish polities in America, and that is why every 
			Irishman can with credit to himself be an Irish patriot in America, 
			doing the best, as every man should do, to make himself great and 
			glorious, by doing the devil and all to make Ireland great, glorious 
			and free.</font></p>
			<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify"><font size="4">I 
			fear I am getting into bad humor now, and perhaps it is bettor for 
			me to cut this morning's work short and run away from my writing 
			desk. I am looking at a lot of letters lying before me that I have 
			selected for publication as I advance into the Fenian movement These 
			letters were written to John O'Mahoney at Fenian headquarters by 
			Fenian organizers, Fenian centers and Fenian missionaries. The 
			writers speak of eternal fidelity to the Fenian cause and promise to 
			it everlasting support. One of the causes of the temporary collapse 
			of Fenianism is that when clouds came on and when the ship got into 
			a storm, the commander came to learn that many of his officers were 
			fresh water sailors; they did not stick to the ship, they left her, 
			they took shipping for seas where there would be no storms, and as 
			to the question of fighting for free land, they went in for having 
			&quot;land without striking a blow.&quot; We in Ireland came to learn that in 
			order to make progress with the cause of Fenianism, it was necessary 
			to kill out the cause of Parliamentary agitation and Parliamentary 
			agitators. The Fenians of Ireland kept up their organization, they 
			kept fighting against odds, because many of the Fenians of America 
			joined the agitators and became organizers of funds for the support 
			of parliamentary policy, just as they were organizers of funds for 
			the support of the Fenian policy that swore it was by the sword 
			alone Ireland could be cut loose from England. The Fenians in 
			Ireland In '63, '64 and '65 completely stamped out the &quot;heaven sent 
			leader,&quot; O'Donoghue of the Glens, and his party. James Stephens was 
			in command of the men of Ireland then, and there was I straight line 
			of duty laid out for them, with he straight policy declared and 
			sworn to—that it was by the sword alone Ireland could be freed. The 
			men of America were supporting that policy then, they are supporting 
			a different policy now, represented by Mr. Parnell and his party, 
			which is one of the causes of the temporary or apparent collapse of 
			Fenianism. I say &quot;apparent,&quot; because I know the true Fenian spirit 
			is still in the heart of the Irish people, but it is overshadowed by 
			he mantle of publicity that Irish American support has given to what 
			is called the Irish National cause of to-day. The Fenian cause has 
			no organ in Ireland to-day. England suppressed it in 1865, and none 
			has arisen since.</font></p>
			<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify"><font size="4">It 
			may not be popular for me to write this way, but it is not for 
			popularity I do this work, nor is it or pay I do it, either. I like 
			popularity as much as any other man on earth, but I like more the 
			other thing that brings me unpopularity just now. And perhaps I like 
			Parnell as well as many who will yowl at me for speaking what I 
			believe to be the truth—speaking it for the good of Ireland, not for 
			my own good certainly, because there is now no pay, profit or 
			emolument to be got by an honest man writing the truth, as he feels 
			it, and acts it regarding Ireland. There is one precedent for my 
			course—John Mitchel gives it and leaves it on record. I am not 
			afraid or ashamed any day to follow John Mitchel. His friend, Thomas 
			Francis Meagher, was going to run for Member of Parliament in 
			Waterford. Mitchel was against his doing so; he opposed him; he 
			wrote in the press against him; he prayed for his defeat. Here are 
			his words as we find hem in his book, &quot;The Last Conquest of 
			Ireland&quot;: We pray for his defeat. If Mr. Meagher were in Parliament 
			man's eyes would be attracted thither once more; some hope of 
			justice might again revive in this too easily deluded people. The 
			nobler his genius, the more earnest his zeal, the more conspicuous 
			his patriotism, just the more mischief would he do in propping up 
			through another session, perhaps through another famine, the 
			miserable delusion of a parliamentary party.</font></p>
			<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify"><font size="4">It 
			is such a delusion as that the Irishmen of America are supporting 
			to-day. Parnell may be as willing to fight for Ireland as you or I. 
			I have in my day met members of Parliament who were willing to fight 
			and willing to take the Fenian oath to fight, and they have told mo 
			so; but they are dead, and as sure as you live, we, too, will be 
			dead before we see Ireland free, if the only help we give to free it 
			is the help to enable Irishmen to fight England in the English 
			Parliament.</font></p>
