<p align="center"><b><font size="7">The speech at Oswald's Grove</font></b></p>
<p align="left"><b>Jeremiah &quot;O'Dynamite&quot; Rossa as some would have called him, was a
die-hard Irish rebel. A Fenian from County Cork who was jailed and sent to
Australia and later 'amnestied' into exile. He arrived in 1871 on the Cuba and
was one of five released prisoners known as the &quot;Cuba 5.&quot; The others
were John Devoy, Charles Underwood O'Connell, Harry Mulleda, and John McClure.
Rossa did not veer from the path of force and&nbsp; was outspoken in his
call for violence against England in order to free Ireland from English rule. He
openly solicited contributions to a &quot;Skirmishing Fund&quot; to be used in
any way necessary to damage England. His fiery oratory not only turned off those
who might prefer a more civilized approach to dealing with the English; but also
those, John Devoy chief of the Clan Na Gael was one, who agreed with his methods in private but wanted all discussion of this
type of 'warfare' kept a secret known only to those in command of the fund.
Foretelling the unrest which brought down the Russian monarchy and ushered in
the Bolsheviks, O'Donovan-Rossa at one point seems to be making a pitch for
joining Karl Marx or one of his adherents in England.&nbsp; </b></p>

<p align="left">&nbsp;&nbsp; <font size="4"><b> Jeremiah O'Donovan Rossa, once
familiarly known as &quot;Dynamite&quot; Rossa, because of his advocacy of that
explosive as the best means of bringing England to terms, was the principal
speaker at the Irish Nationalist meeting and picnic at Oswald's grove yesterday.
An estimate placed the number of person in attendance at 10,000. This figure may
have been considerably exceeded, for the crowd was constantly shifting, and the
people were scattered about the grounds.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The same sort of amusements were indulged in as at Sunnyside.
The wheels of fortune and the ball-throwing and ring-pitching had all the
business they could attend to, both day and evening. It was a jolly crowd. There
was a dancing pavilion, and the floor was never vacant, a band playing for those
who preferred dancing to listening to the speeches of Rossa and his colleagues.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The speakers were escorted from McCoy's hotel at noon, the
committee being headed by John P McGoorty, John T Keating, and William F Mahoney.
In the carriages were, besides James F Eagan and Senator T C Sullivan of New
York, the following well-known Nationalists: Colonel J J Reilly, Colonel R[icard]
O'S[ullivan] Burke, Captain H B Ryan, Myles McPadden, S J Donleavy, Secretary of
the fire and police commission of Denver; Captain Joseph O'Donahue, John Bigane,
Representative Michael J Kelley, John J Mahony, James Cleary, James J Carroll, P
B Flanagan, Thomas Reynolds, Maurice A Crotty, W E Fogarty, A J Ryan, William
McCoy, James J McManamon, Daniel Donahue, E F O'Riordan, William Dwyer, E M
Lahiff, Cornelius Callahan, Major J J Casey.</b></font></p>
<p align="center"><font size="4"><b>Gets a Rousing Welcome</b></font></p>
<p align="left">&nbsp;&nbsp; <font size="4"><b> The principles of the
Nationalists beign &quot;Ireland fre by peaceable means if possible, but free by
force if necessary,&quot; Rossa was given a rousing welcome. The majority of
those who came to hear him held ideas in accord with those of the speaker. His
remarks were received with all the enthusiasm of the days when Larkin and O'Brien
were plotting, and every filing at England was vociferously applauded.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; John P McGoorty was the chairman, and he lost no time in
introducing the orator of the day. Mr. Rossa has aged considerably since he last
spoke to a gathering of his countrymen in this city. His voice is still strong
and resonant, and he easily made himself heard. He took for his text, &quot;You
may as well put your trust in the devil to get to heaven as to trust the English
to ree Ireland.&quot;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He told his hearers that there was no doubt the large
emigration was a drain on the power of the Irish at home that bids fair in the
end to leave none to fight for the liberty they sought on their own soil. The
flight of the young men and women from Ireland was taking away the sinews of
war, he said, but yet, even if they remained and did nothing to aid the cause of
independence, no good could come by remaining.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He thought that force was the only way to make England act.
The policy of England was to drive every Irishman away. Agitation in Parliament
was a poor way to convince her of error.</b></font></p>
<p align="center"><font size="4"><b>Believes in Force</b></font></p>
<p align="left">&nbsp;&nbsp; <font size="4"><b> &quot;Talk of gaining any
concessions for Ireland by other means than fire and sword is only indulged in
my enemies of the green isle,&quot; said Rossa. &quot;I saw the great fire in
Chicago in 1871 and the partial destruction of Boston by flames. Those
conflagrations show that a fire, ignited with the wind in the right direction,
can sweep over a great urban area. If blazes were started simultaneously in a
thousand places in London on a windy day that center of oppression and robbery
would be almost entirely destroyed. Then would be our time to strike for the
freedom of our country.<br>
</b></font>&nbsp;&nbsp; <font size="4"><b> &quot;I have talked with English
radicals, who are said by our enemies to be willing to aid us to get home rule.
A famous English radical parliamentarian told me that if the Irish party would
first work to obtain for the industrial classes in England such laws a they want
they would then lend their efforts to our cause. His sentiments are those of all
his party. I know that from personal investigations.&quot;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It was rumored throughout the grounds that there were several
&quot;British spies&quot; in the crowd to note the speeches and watch the temper
of the people, but if any of England's emissaries were present they were not
discovered. If they were there, Rossa's denunciation of Kin Edward and his
advisers would have given them food for dispatches to Scotland Yard. He closed
an address full of brilliant sentences with the hope that some day the land of
his birth might ultimately be free.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Freedom would come, he declared, when Ireland's sons
throughout the world stood together, and with strong arms and fearless hearts
battled for independence.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; James F Eagan of Dublin and Senator Sullivan of New York also
spoke, and they were frequently applauded. The evening programme was similar in
character. Mr. Rossa spoke again and other addresses were made by John T Keating
and other local speakers.</b></font></p>
