<p>In 1857 in New York at the law office of Michael Doheny, a
group of veterans from the 1848 Rising in Ireland formed a secret
organization to begin training and recruiting soldiers in America
to drive the British out of Ireland. They sent a message to James
Stephens in Ireland who agreed to join their cause. The leader
of the American group, John O'Mahony, was chosen to lead the
American organization which called itself the Fenian Brotherhood.
James Stepens headed up the organization in Ireland called the
Irish Republican Brotherhood or IRB. In both countries they began
to drill and train for the coming battle. The Civil War threw a
wrench into the plans of the Fenians. Many Irishmen, both North
and South, joined up to fight in the units forming to decide if
the United States were to remain a nation. The
Fenians, helpless to prevent thousands of Irishmen from joining
to serve in the Union and Confederate armies, changed their
stance and began to praise the Civil War as a training ground for
the coming battle in Ireland.</p>

<p>The Fenians and the IRB were secret organizations whose
members swore an oath, before God, to take their orders from the
Brotherhood. This led to problems with the Catholic Church who
went so far as to excommunicate members who took such an oath.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The Organization was made up of &quot;Circles&quot; with the
leader being a &quot;Centre&quot; based on what O'Mahony and
Stephens had seen formed in France during their exile after the
aborted 1848 rebellion. The movement grew as the Civil War came
to a close and peaked in 1866. Stephens foolishly
promised the year of 1865 as the year the great rebellion would
occur. Stephens and many were captured in the Fall of 1865 in a raid on the
Irish People, an IRB newspaper in Ireland. Although Stephens escaped from British prison,
he lost a lot of support.&nbsp; A split occurred in the Brotherhood as William Randall Roberts led a splinter group called
the &quot;Senate Wing&quot; in opposition to O'Mahony and
Stephens. Roberts and a Civil War general, Thomas Sweeny, devised
a plan to attack Canada. O'Mahony and Stephens wanted all efforts
to be focused on an invasion of Ireland. In April of 1866 O'Mahony, desperate to outdo Roberts
and maintain control of the Fenian Brotherhood,&nbsp; changed tactics and launched
his own Canadian attack which at Campobello an Island off the coast
of Maine. The attack was a fiasco. The sole accomplishment was to capture a flag from an
undefended Canadian custom house. The United States arrested the Fenian troops and the &quot;attack&quot; was over.
James Stephens then accepted O'Mahony's resignation. The tide swung to
Roberts who with Thomas Sweeny and Colonel John O'Neill, launched a two
pronged attack into Canada in June of 1866. O'Neill was successful, routing a
Canadian militia at Ridgeway, but the United States stepped in
and cut off re-enforcements to O'Neill who was forced to retreat
back into New York near Buffalo where all were arrested. The U. S. government then
set the Fenians free with rail passage back to their homes. A second attack
was less energetically launched at the same time at Pigeon Hill, Vermont but the
Fenians did not stay
in Canada long enough to greet the British Regulars headed in their
direction. Ridgeway was hailed as a great Fenian victory. Three years later, in
1870, another attempt at entering Canada was made in a two pronged muddle from
Eccles Hill at the Vermont-Quebec border and Holbrook Corners on the New York-
Quebec border.&nbsp; and the Fenian Movement began to vaporize. O'Mahony died a pauper
in New York in 1877. Roberts became a politician. Stephens lived in
poverty in France and died in 1901 after being allowed to return to
Ireland. O'Neill, the hero of Ridgeway, led a farcical attack on
a trading post near Pembina on the Minnesota border with Canada, where he
was again captured. O'Neill mellowed and led an Irish migration of
homesteaders into Nebraska where a town is named after him.</p>

<p>The embittered Irish who joined the Fenians in hope of freeing
Ireland were deluded by their leaders and led on by the United
States, emboldening them to attack Canada. With better
preparation and leadership, it is, perhaps, just feasible such a
movement might succeed. Divided and riddled with spies and
charlatans it had no chance. John Devoy, not really a Fenian as he was a member
of the IRB in Dublin in 1866 when arrested for recruiting British Irish-born
soldiers into the IRB, was
leader of the group which followed in the footsteps of the Fenian
Brotherhood. Ultra secret and more formidable, known outwardly as the Clan Na Gael,
&quot;the Irish race,&quot; it met and corresponded as the United Brotherhood
and became a force to be reckoned with when it formed a close alliance
with the remnants of the IRB in Ireland. The IRB later evolved
into Sein Fein and the IRA whose constant harassment of the
British, especially under Michael Collins, finally led to the
freeing of the Southern Counties of Ireland which became the
present Republic of Ireland..</p>
