		<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">&nbsp;</p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><font size="4">As I 
		spoke in the last chapter of meeting Thomas Frames Meagher I ought to 
		have said a few words more regarding him. There is a sadness about the 
		manner of his death which makes his name and his memory dearer to those 
		who knew him. I have spoken with many soldiers of the Irish Brigade who 
		went through the war with Meagher, and it is wonderful with what 
		affection his memory is cherished by them. Night after night have 
		listened to Major Patrick K. Horgan tell of his prowess on the 
		battlefield and of his repeated exhortation to his men to bear in mind 
		that Ireland was looking at them and that they were making a name to 
		brighten a page of the history of their fallen land. But it is not 
		writing Meagher's obituary or biography I am now; to do that properly I 
		should have Major Horgan's knowledge of him. What I have in my mind is 
		to bring forward the testimony of another man who is dead and to leave 
		it on record in rebuttal of false stories that surround the death of 
		Thomas Francis Meagher.</font></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><font size="4">General 
		Ryan, who was shot by the Spaniards in Cuba, came to me one day in New 
		York and offered himself and his sword in a fight for Ireland's freedom. 
		Ireland, he said, had a first claim on him: he was a man of Irish blood 
		and bone, and the brand of Ireland's slavery fell as much upon him and 
		his name its it did upon any other man. During the conversation I had 
		with General Ryan he told me ho was in the company of General Meagher 
		the night he was drowned in the Missouri River. &quot;We were in the saloon 
		of the steamer,&quot; said General Ryan. &quot;General Meagher excused himself for 
		a moment; he went on deck; we thought he was rather long away and we 
		went on deck to find him; the ropes that lay around must have tripped 
		him, and he must have fallen overboard. I had like to be tripped myself 
		in searching for him. I have heard some of his countrymen meanly 
		insinuate that Meagher might have been 'out of the way' that night. I 
		assure you on the word of a man and a soldier that he was as sober as I 
		am now and as free from drink.&quot; General Ryan was sober when he spoke 
		those words to me, and I call God to witness that I am speaking the 
		truth of the two dead men.</font></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><font size="4">As I have 
		introduced General Ryan into my story of the Fenian movement I must tell 
		a tale in connection with him that may be a lesson to other public men. 
		This is not egotism—to class myself among public men. The newspapers 
		will have it that I am a public man; they make a public man of me, no 
		matter how much I like to live in private and do my work in private.</font></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><font size="4">The day 
		of the Commune funeral in New York — shortly after I was released from 
		English prisons — I was standing on the center of Fifth street and the 
		Bowery, New York; the funeral was passing by. I was looking at it, like 
		hundreds of others who were on the footpath. General Ryan was in a 
		carriage in the funeral; he saw me; he drove his carriage to where I 
		stood and invited me to a seat in it. I thanked him, but declined; he 
		said he wanted to speak a few words to me on the subjects we were 
		talking of a few days before. Those subjects were Ireland and Thomas 
		Francis Meagher; I got into the carriage with General Ryan; next morning 
		it was telegraphed in all the newspapers throughout the country that 
		O'Donovan Rossa had a carriage in the Commune funeral. I had engagements 
		to lecture in Manchester, N. H., and other places, and I had a telegram 
		from Manchester saying the engagement was broken off—they did not want a 
		communist to lecture for them. I got into that difficulty, as into many 
		another difficulty in my life, on account of knowing General Ryan and 
		General Meagher in connection with Irish revolutionary affairs; it is 
		very likely I'll get into more difficulties in my life in connection 
		with Irish revolutionary affairs unless I die out of them. The Irish 
		people here in America are more slave souled than the Irish people In 
		Ireland. I could not be killed out of society in Ireland for proclaiming 
		my opinions there. I can he killed in America, and by the Irish of 
		America, too; and the reason is that Irish born slaves are allowed to 
		wear the garb of freemen hero — just as all slaves are allowed freedom 
		in this land; not at all saying that Irishmen have not done their share 
		of fighting for its freedom. But to enable the Irishman to stand erect 
		in America his should be in the position of feeling that his native land 
		was not a land enslaved. I meet many Irishmen in America, who say: &quot;What 
		is Ireland to me now? Sure, I'm a freeman here. &quot;The negroes who escaped 
		from slavery in former days have had some share of my regard; these 
		Irish slaves I speak of have none of it. In Ireland they were the 
		“satisfied slaves” of the satirist; in America they are satisfied and 
		content, while Ireland groans in chains. One Irishman who boldly fronts 
		the enemy on Irish soil is worth a thousand of his kind here. Well, to 
		make myself popular, I'll put it this way: One Parnell in Ireland is 
		worth a thousand Parnells in America. That is not committing myself to 
		saying that a thousand Parnells here or there is worth a thraneen to the 
		freedom of Ireland — until they go further than talk.</font></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><font size="4">I’ll take 
		myself back to Dublin now, where I started the <i>Irish People</i> 
		newspaper at the end of the last chapter and at the end of the year 
		1863. Agents for the sale of the paper were got in the principal towns 
		of the country, but many of those agents had to give up the sale of it, 
		as the priests and the landlords in several localities opposed its 
		circulation. The word &quot;boycott&quot; was not then in use, but in a free 
		country I can take liberty with the word, carry it back a distance of 
		twenty years, and say they boycotted the paper. Many of our agents and 
		subscribers resisted the boycotting, and very angry feelings were 
		growing up between priests and people. About the landlords the boys did 
		not care a pin, but to have the priests against them was something that 
		set them mad. &quot;Harvey Birch&quot;—Tom Brougham, of Tipperary, now in 
		Cupertino; &quot;Hugo del Monte&quot;—Hugh Byrne, of Wicklow, who died in San 
		Francisco last year, and several other correspondents wrote down those 
		priests who front their altars denounced the men and made known the 
		existence of the &quot;illegal&quot; society. The oath these priests swore at the 
		College of Maynooth was published in the paper — the oath that swore 
		them to be &quot;loyal and true to the Queen&quot; and to make known to her all 
		combinations and conspiracies that may be hatching against her rule in 
		the realm of Ireland. If the priest preached that it was sinful for the 
		Irishman to take an oath to fight for Ireland, the Irishman answered him 
		that it was not sinful at all when the Irishman took an oath to fight 
		for England, even against his own country, Ireland.</font></p>

		the recruits into the organization had seen service in the English army, 
		in the Pope's army, in the French army, in the Austrian army, In the 
		American army, in the Russian army—in fact, in all armies of the world; 
		and they could fight in all armies of the world without periling the 
		salvation of their souls; but now that they had sworn to fight for their 
		native land it was ridiculous to think they were to be damned for all 
		eternity. Hell was not hot enough nor eternity long enough to punish the 
		Fenians, said Bishop Moriarty, of Kerry; &quot;They were worse to the country 
		than a seven years' famine,&quot; said Archbishop Cullen, of Dublin. Bad 
		blood was growing between some of the priests and some of the people; a 
		priest called Father Collins, in the Parish of Cape Clear, the southern 
		point of Ireland, was burned in effigy in Skibbereen; he had denounced 
		Fenianism from the altar of his chapel, and some few days after some men 
		were arrested; it was said the priest's denunciation led to the arrests, 
		hence his being burned In effigy by the people. I was sorry to see this 
		done, as some time before that I had been the guest of that priest and 
		had slept in his house; it was not on a mission of Fenianism, but on a 
		mission of charity, I was at the time. The picture of that mission and 
		all around, it is so vivid before me to-day; it is so illustrative of 
		the conditions of Irish life that make Fenianism necessary, or make 
		necessary some &quot;ism&quot; that would abate the horrors of landlordism as I 
		saw it and felt it in Ireland, that I make no apology for penciling it 
		for the reader now:</font></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><font size="4">This 
		Island of Cape Clear, on the southern point of Ireland, is passed 
		closely by every ship sailing between New York and the Cove of Cork. It 
		is inhabited by a hardy, hearty race of people, all speaking the Irish 
		language. The land is parceled out in small farms, and the landlord is 
		one of the Beecher family that came in for it in Cromwell's time, when 
		it was confiscated from the O'Driscolls. Fully half the inhabitants of 
		the island are of the name of O'Driscoll. Shortly before I came to 
		Dublin to assume the management of the Irish people there was great 
		distress among the people of the island, so great that the Board of 
		Guardians of the Skibbereen Union resolved to send in special relief. 
		Rumor had it that the people were dying of starvation; that the potato 
		crop had failed and that the fish, oats and wheat bad been seized by the 
		landlord for the rent.</font></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><font size="4">The 
		guardians wanted a man for the emergency who would start into the island 
		and distribute the eight sacks of Indian meal they had ordered. They 
		sent for me and asked me if I would do the work; I said I would, and 
		taking with me another man, Michael O'Driscoll, we set sail for the 
		islands of Cape Clear and Sherkin, some eight or ten miles distant from 
		Skibbereen. We reached Sherkin first and landed three sacks of the meal 
		there, going on farther to Cape Clear with tile other five sacks. As we 
		were landing the meal at Sherkin we saw a man stretched on the beach, 
		and we wondered ho did not come with some other men to our assistance. 
		We were told he was too weak to stand; we went up to him, gave him some 
		of the bread and meat we brought with us for lunch. When we returned to 
		the island next day we found that the man was dead.</font></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><font size="4">In Cape 
		Clear we stopped at the priest's house .It was nightfall as we were 
		getting in, and Father Collins, expecting the temporary relief, was on 
		the lookout for It. He had the five sacks of meal taken to his house and 
		word sent all over the Island to have the poor people be at his place in 
		the morning, as a little relief had come. O'Driscoll and I slept at the 
		priest's that night and were as hospitably entertained as a poor priest 
		in a poor parish could entertain people. In the morning early, before 
		breakfast, we distributed the five sacks of meal, giving a half gallon 
		measure of it—about three and a half pounds, what the law allowed—to 
		every adult poor person. When all were served we had one measure of meal 
		left, and Father Collins suggested that we give that to a poor, bed 
		ridden old woman, who was up there on the side of the hill. One of the, 
		neighbors was present who bad got the, half gallon of meal for her. That 
		neighbor should cook it for her, as the bedridden woman could do nothing 
		for herself, and had no one in the cabin with her, and it would not be 
		much out of the way of charity to give this woman for her trouble the 
		additional measure of meal. I acted on the priest's suggestion, and 
		recorded seven pounds of meal given to Kittie O'Driscoll.</font></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><font size="4">On our 
		way to the boat Father Collins took us to see the bedridden woman, 
		Kittie O'Driscoll. He went on his hands and knees and crept into a hole 
		in the aide of a hill; I crept in after him, and there, stretched on 
		flag stones, with nothing between her and the flag stones but her shreds 
		of body clothes and tufts of heath, was the poor bedridden woman. 
		Leaving that place the priests took us in to some cabins whore children 
		were lying dead—dead from hunger; took us into other cabins where the 
		doors were flag stones—any things that wore there in the shape of wooden 
		doors having been burned for firing.</font></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><font size="4">To make a 
		long story short—the next board day of the Skibbereen Union came on, and 
		I was in the presence of the Board of Guardians with my report of what I 
		saw and what I did as relieving officer in the islands of Inis Sherkin 
		and Cape Clear, visiting these islands on two occasions. I told the 
		truth—the God's truth. John Beecher, the landlord, was present, and he 
		made a fierce attack upon my report. I told him the report was telling 
		the truth, and that he knew it was telling the truth. He pounced upon 
		the item that recorded the giving of seven pounds of meal to one person, 
		whereas the poor law only allowed the giving of three and a half pounds 
		to any one person; he declared that was going beyond the bounds of duty, 
		that it was breaking the law. He proposed that I be dismissed from the 
		office of temporary relieving officer; that I get no salary for my 
		services, so far, and that the price of the three pounds and a half of 
		extra meal that I gave the bed ridden woman be charged to me. The 
		resolution was passed by the Board of Guardians; there was a majority of 
		ex officio guardians—landlords—in the board room that day,</font></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><font size="4">When I 
		found myself thus summarily dismissed and declared a culprit, I summoned 
		that Board of Guardians to appear before the barrister at Quarter 
		Sessions. I, on oath, told that barrister my story as I tell it here, 
		and lie gave me a decree for a quarter of a year's salary as relieving 
		officer against the Guardians of the Skibbereen Union. He said they had 
		no right to treat me the way they did, when I, on an emergency, 
		volunteered to go and do their work without fee or reward. This John 
		Beecher I speak of is one of &quot;the quality&quot; in Ireland; he is one of the 
		sons of Sir Henry Beecher, I of Ballygiblin, and his wife is Lady Emily 
		Hare, daughter to the Earl of Listowel. While you have landlordism of 
		that kind in Ireland you never can have Ireland free, and you're bound 
		to have landlordism of that kind there as long as England lives there.</font></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><font size="4">This is 
		not talk that the Irish parrot patriots and peacock patriots of America 
		or of Ireland. will like to read, but it is the truth nevertheless. 
		Irishmen were rampant mad through this country, a few years ago, 
		singing:</font></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:1.0in;text-align:justify">
		<font size="4">&quot;Land for the landless people</font></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:1.0in;text-align:justify">
		<font size="4">Land without striking a blow.&quot;</font></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><font size="4">But 
		England struck a few blows at them and scattered them to the winds. They 
		will come together again in one fashion or another to carry on the 
		delusion. I cannot help it; I cannot stop them; I'll go back to Dublin 
		and follow up my story of the Fenian movement.</font></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><font size="4">I was 
		talking of Father Collins having been burned in effigy for denouncing 
		that movement and saying something that led. to the arrest of some of 
		his parishioners—the same Father Collins that with me witnessed the 
		misery of his parishioners at Cape Clear and with me dealt out the 
		niggardly dole of Poor Law relief to them. To die of starvation is a far 
		worse death than to die fighting against a power that starves you while 
		you work and produce food sufficient to sustain life. Why Father Collins 
		and other priests of Ireland. are against people who meditate fighting 
		for Ireland's freedom is a mystery to me. Perhaps the priests know the 
		people better than I know them; perhaps the priests know the people are 
		not free, able and willing to fight—to fight England successfully.</font></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><font size="4">I was one 
		evening at the house of John O'Donovan, the celebrated Irish scholar, at 
		No. 136 Northumberland street, Dublin. His children—six or seven 
		sons—were around and Father Meehan was at the table. It was after my 
		first release from prison and we talked on the subject of my 
		Imprisonment and on the cause it represented.</font></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><font size="4">&quot;The 
		priests will never let the people fight,&quot; said John O'Donovan, &quot;and I 
		fear you are only laying down a life of trouble for yourself in the 
		course you are pursuing.&quot;</font></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><font size="4">I 
		endeavored to show him that in the matter of fighting for Ireland the 
		people were getting independent of the priests, and would not be led or 
		frightened away from the fight by what the priests said. Ho half doubted 
		what I said, but felt pleased when I assured him it was so. Father 
		Meehan did not have much to say on the subject. I went to my hotel in 
		his carriage that night. John O'Donovan's sons—three of them, John, 
		Edmond and William—were afterward put to prison in connection with the 
		cause of Fenianism. John was drowned In the Missouri River, Edmond was 
		killed in the late Egyptian war, it is said, William is in New York as I 
		write these lines; they were a happy family and a gifted family when I 
		knew them in the old house at home. In Portland Convict Prison one day 
		talking to John O'Leary on the likelihood or unlikehood of the fight 
		going on whether we were dead or alive, I said I thought Edmond 
		O'Donovan was one man who would never let the flag go down as long as he 
		lived. When the Irish People was started the young O'Donovans used to 
		call at tile office to see me. I introduced them to Pagan O'Leary, who 
		is now in one of the Soldiers' Homes of America Hampton, Va., I think. 
		The Pagan talked Fenianism to the young men, and from that sprang the 
		trouble of their becoming inmates of some of England's prisons 
		afterward.</font></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><font size="4">An 
		English soldier came in to the Irish People one day and asked for me. I 
		looked at him. I knew the face, but his being in soldier's clothes 
		staggered my recognition of him for a time. He was one of our men in the 
		south of Ireland who had listed into the English army. As he is living 
		still I will not tell his name. I introduced this English soldier to 
		Pagan O'Leary. The Pagan took him in hand and swore him over again. From 
		that connection sprang the military organization of Fenianism in the 
		English army. To such an extent did it grow that before twelve months 
		there were fully twelve thousand red coats sworn in in England, Ireland 
		and Scotland. The Pagan traveled from camp to camp, carrying with him 
		introductions from soldiers ho had sworn in to other soldiers who had 
		not been sworn. On a mission of this kind he was arrested in Athlone in 
		December, 1864. One soldier refused to take the oath: he made some noise 
		about the matter, the Pagan was arrested, tried at the Assizes, found 
		guilty and sentenced to seven years' transportation.</font></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><font size="4">When the 
		Pagan was arrested other men took up his work; five or six of them wore 
		engaged on such a mission. I knew them. It was my business occasionally 
		to furnish them with &quot;resources of civilization,&quot; or resources for 
		recruiting, but I have not permission to mention their names here.</font></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><font size="4">The most 
		strange and singular things occurred in connection with this recruiting 
		business; every organizer has some curious story or another to tell. I 
		was going from Dublin to the races at Punchestown one day. The train 
		left me off at Celbridge. and I had two hours' Stay before I could make 
		connection with Punchestown, I walked into the country and, meeting a 
		dragoon soldier, I got chatting with him. He was from Carlow, and I 
		happened to know some of his family. Ile had enlisted through some freak 
		of folly or of anger, or it may be through a freak of love. Many a 
		decent mother's son gets into the English Army that way. It is a kind of 
		self imposed transportation or ostracism from the home and family. But 
		to make a long story short, .I swore in this dragoon soldier before I 
		parted with him; I swore him to renounce allegiance to England and to 
		fight for Ireland's freedom when called upon. Some months after he 
		called at the office in Dublin to see me, but I was away. In 1864 I 
		swore him in, and in 1865 I went again to the races of Punchestown. 
		During the day a drunken soldier riding through the race course 
		attracted crowds of people. I drew near to him. I recognized in him the 
		man I had sworn in a year before that; William Roantree, of Leixlip, was 
		with me. &quot;William,&quot; said I &quot;we must try and save that man, he is one of 
		ours, I swore him in a year ago.&quot;</font></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><font size="4">I went in 
		front of the horse and caught the soldier's eye; he recognized me, held 
		down his head and walked his horse quietly away. The people who saw him 
		so actively drunk a minute before that were expressing surprise that he 
		could have sobered so suddenly.</font></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><font size="4">This 
		recruiting of men in the English Army was not going on without having 
		the English government notice it. They did not make any clamor about it, 
		but they quietly drafted off to India and China and other foreign places 
		the regiments that were most demoralized. One regiment was sent away in 
		which were seven hundred men who had been initiated into the 
		organization. The night before they left I met some of the sergeants in 
		Thomas street and they swore, again, wherever they would be when the 
		fight was going on that they would turn and fight against England too. 
		Dublin was ours at that time any night or day we wished to have it. 
		These soldiers asked that they be not called upon to open the fight—that 
		they be not called upon to turn on their Englishmen comrades and 
		slaughter them, &quot;but any night,&quot; said they, &quot;that you desire to 
		continence the work, let us know. The barrack gates will be open to you, 
		come in and take possession; we will march out with you and fight side 
		by side with you for our country's freedom against whatever enemy 
		opposes us.&quot; More than that could not ho expected or required from them.</font></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><font size="4">Whenever 
		any of our men knew a decent father or mother who had a son in the 
		soldiers a letter of introduction was got from the father or mother to 
		that son and it was easy to make a Fenian of him; wherever any of our 
		men knew a man or woman who had a brother in the army a letter of 
		introduction was got to the soldier. It was very seldom that the 
		missioner who carried the letter failed to make &quot;a man&quot; of the soldier. 
		I was at a private meeting of Fenians in Hardman Street, Manchester, one 
		night. An old man said a son of his was sergeant in a certain place in 
		England, and had charge of the whole citadel. I got a letter from the 
		father to the son, and before a week that son was a sworn Fenian. The 
		old man is dead, but I will not tell his name, as the son may be still 
		living, drawing a pension from England. Not having an opportunity to 
		fight for Ireland, those Irishmen fought their time through for England; 
		it is the Irishman's story all over the world—a sad. and sorrowful one, 
		singing mournfully-</font></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:1.0in;text-align:justify">
		<font size="4">&quot;A home or a country remains not to me.&quot;</font></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><font size="4">In the 
		spring of 1864 I was called from Dublin to Cork; the men who burned the 
		priest's effigy were on trial at the assizes and other men from 
		Bailincollig were on trial charged with walking the public roads in 
		military order. Nine or ten of those Ballincollig men were found 
		&quot;guilty&quot; and sentenced each to twelve months' imprisonment; the effigy 
		men escaped without any punishment. At this visit of mine to Cork I met, 
		for the first time, a man who to-day is pretty well known in New York 
		and Brooklyn—that is John Kearney—a traveler for the large importing 
		house of H. K. Thurber &amp; Co. John was then an Irishman and a Fenian, 
		whatever he is now. I suppose he's too rich now to be anything good for 
		Ireland. He and I slept in a double bedded room at the hotel of John J. 
		Geary the first night we met in Cork City. A policeman from Limerick, 
		who was on duty at the Assizes, was introduced to John as belonging to a 
		decent family in Limerick, and John swore him in a Fenian that night. He 
		often told me since that that policeman through all the troubles of '65, 
		'66 and '67 remained as true as steel.</font></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><font size="4">John J. 
		Geary went with me to Bandon next day, as the North Cork militia were In 
		training there, and he knew some of them to belong to us. When I got 
		among the regiment I found that nearly the whole of the men belonged to 
		us. We spent the evening among them, one of them singing with smiling 
		significance,</font></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:1.0in;text-align:justify">
		<font size="4">Oh, my heart Is weary, weary,</font></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:1.0in;text-align:justify">
		<font size="4">Weary waiting for the fray!</font></p>
