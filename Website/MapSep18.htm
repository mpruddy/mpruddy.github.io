		<p align="justify">In the upper left center of the map Minty is shown 
		back across Reed's Bridge where the brigade had retreated from Pea Vine 
		Valley in front of Bushrod Johnson's Division. To the left of Minty at 
		Dyer's Bridge are the men loaned to Minty by Wilder. </p>
		<p align="justify">Wilder's main force can be seen in the center of the 
		picture at Alexander's Bridge.</p>
		<p align="justify">Thomas' Union troops can be seen heading for the area 
		where Minty and Wilder are in the evening of the 18th.</p>
		<p align="justify">The rest of the Union Army is off the map at the 
		bottom right. It is not hard to imagine what would have happened if 
		Minty and Wilder had fallen back and Bushrod Johnson, followed by Hood 
		and Longstreet had fallen on the left flank of the Union lines before 
		Thomas troops reached the area.</p>
