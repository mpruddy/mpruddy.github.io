        <td width="100%"><font size="3"><strong>Henry Albert
        Potter was born April 6</strong><sup><strong>th</strong></sup><strong>
        1840 to Edward Coke Potter, son of an old New York
        family, and Sophia Welter, daughter of Dutch parents from
        New Jersey, in the town of Starkey, Yates County, New
        York. The family moved to Michigan and homesteaded a
        farm, but Henry stayed to finish school at Starkey
        Seminary in Starkey. At 17 he graduated and joined the
        family in Ovid Michigan where he began teaching school in
        the winters while working on the farm in the summers. </strong></font><p><font
        size="3"><strong>At the time the war began Henry was a
        loyal Republican and from his letters it can be seen that
        he encouraged a few of the Ovid boys to join him in
        signing up with Company B of the 4</strong><sup><strong>th</strong></sup><strong>
        Michigan Cavalry. Later as some died and others were
        maimed for life he regretted influencing them to join.
        But he himself never wavered in staunch defense of the
        war and the Union. Henry joined up as a sergeant and
        after Stones River was promoted first to 2</strong><sup><strong>nd</strong></sup><strong>
        Lieutenant then 1</strong><sup><strong>st</strong></sup><strong>
        Lieutenant. In August of 1864 after Tullahoma,
        Chickamauga, and the campaign to Atlanta, he was promoted
        to Captain of Company H and served as such until July of
        1865 when he was discharged at the mustering out of the
        regiment. </strong></font></p>
        <p><font size="3"><strong>After the war, he returned to
        Starkey where he met his wife to be, Katherine Elisabeth
        Gardner. They had 3 children, two sons who died as
        children and a daughter, Bertha, who was my maternal
        grandmother. </strong></font></p>
        <p><font size="3"><strong>Before the war Henry had worked
        as a clerk at Pearl and Faxon dry goods store. When he
        returned he became a partner with Faxon from 1866 to
        1871, then the store became Faxon, Potter and Swarthout
        and from 1871 to 1883: Potter and Swarthout. Potter
        bought out Swarthout and then in 1884 sold it back to
        Swarthout. Potter then bought a dairy in Ovid which he
        ran until 1901. In 1902 he became a partner in Jillson
        and Potter mercantile. He became part owner and President
        of First National Bank of Ovid until 1905. When a clerk
        was caught speculating with the funds, Potter went back
        to work and at 60 opened another dry good store. He was
        able to pay off the bank&#146;s debt to the depositors.
        Potter retired at 75. He lived to be 95 and spent his
        later years (1919-1935) at Quaker Hill in New York at the
        home of his son in law, Samuel Palmer, who was the
        Minister of the local Presbyterian church.</strong></font></p>
        <p><font size="3"><strong>In 1869 joined the George
        Winans post of the GAR. He belonged to Grace Methodist
        Church in Ovid and was chairman of the building committee
        which erected the church. </strong></font></p>
        <p><font size="3"><strong>Henry&#146;s favorite Civil War
        story was of charging his horse up a hill in a skirmish
        somewhere around Lookout Mountain in Georgia. He always
        maintained the Rebels could stand in the open and fire
        their muskets accurately while the Union boys had to
        steady their muskets against posts and trees. As he
        charged up the hill, with shells whizzing around him, he
        looked down to see a Rebel taking dead aim on him.
        &quot;Did you duck?&quot; the listeners invariably would
        ask. Henry always said firmly &quot;a Cavalry Officer
        doesn&#146;t duck.&quot; Luckily for him and me the horse
        raised his head up as the Rebel fired and the took the
        bullet meant for great grandpa. &quot;Oh, she was a noble
        beast&quot; was the way he always finished off the story.
        He wrote many letters during the war and over 60 of his
        letters and his diary were donated to the State of
        Michigan and are at the Archives in Lansing.</strong></font></p>
