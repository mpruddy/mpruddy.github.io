<p align="justify">WHERE there have been so many individual instances of 
gallantry as the personal adventures of the Fenians exhibit, it is difficult to 
assign the palm of particular distinction to any one; but it will doubtless be 
conceded that the fight at Kilclooney Wood, between three Fenians and the 
British forces, was the most gallant and remarkable conflict of the rising. 
Indeed, it is well calculated to add a special glory to the cause associated 
with it, and to indicate a lasting reputation for those engaged in it. That 
three Fenians should defiantly resist and offer battle to one hundred and twenty 
soldiers, besides the district constabulary, borders almost on the marvelous. 
But men, inspired as</p>
<p align="justify"><b>• 262 FENIAN HEROES AND MARTYRS.</b></p>
<p align="justify"><br>
they were, are capable of any sacrifice—even life itself. The names of these 
self-sacrificing, daring men, are Peter O'Neill Crowley, John Edward Kelly and 
John McClure ; and their example and record may be handed down to the admiration 
of those who honor noble deeds- and will strive to emulate them.<br>
Peter O'Neill Crowley was born on the 23d May, 1832, at Ballymacoda, in the 
county of Cork. His father was a respectable farmer, living in the locality, and 
his mother was the niece of Father Peter O'Neill, who, flogged in the City of 
Cork in the year '98, was afterwards sentenced to transportation for life for 
his alleged complicity in the rebellion of that year. While yet young, Peter 
Crowley's father died, and his granduncle, the priest, who had been liberated 
from jail after five years' incarceration, took the boy under his care, and at 
the time of his death directed that due attention should 'be paid to educate him 
in all the modern branches of education.<br>
As the wrongs suffered by Father O'Neill were treasured by the family—becoming 
an inspiration to patriotism—and as they receive an additional interest from the 
blood poured out by young Crowley to avenge them, a brief account of them, found 
in &quot;A Critical and Historical Review of Fox's Book of Martyrs, by William 
Eusebius Andrews,&quot; will prove of sad interest. Most of the narrative is 
extracted from Father O'Neill's own &quot; Remonstrance,&quot; dated October 23, 1803. The 
extract will speak for itself ; we shall only premise that it was written in 
reply to a law-lord who had spoken of Father O'Neill as &quot; one proved to</p>

have been guilty of sanctioning the murders of 1798, transported to Botany Bay, 
and since pardoned by the mercy of Government.&quot; After denying in the most solemn 
manner that he was guilty of the offence charged against him at his arrest, in 
1799, he thus<br>
proceeds :<br>
&quot; It was my peculiar misfortune that the charges then made , against me were not 
only withheld from myself, but even my Mends had no intimation of them, except 
by common report, which then was busily employed in disseminating the various 
atrocities supposed to have been committed by me ; but nothing specifically 
authenticated had transpired ; the very committal was so vague as to have 
excited the astonishment of a professional friend of mine in Dublin, and to have 
eventually led to my discharge. I shall now proceed to the particulars of my 
case : Immediately upon my arrest, I was brought into Youghal, where, without 
any previous trial, I was confined in a loathsome receptacle of the barrack, 
called the black hole—rendered still more offensive by the stench of the common 
necessary adjoining it.<br>
&quot; In that dungeon I remained from Friday until Monday, when I was conducted to 
the Ball-alley to receive my punishment. No trial had yet intervened, nor ever 
after. I was stripped and tied up ; six soldiers stood forth for this operation 
; some of them right-handed, some of them left-handed men, two at a time (as I 
judge from the quickness of the lashes), and relieved at intervals, until I had 
received two hundred and seventy-five lashes, so vigorously and so deeply 
inflicted that my back and points of my shoulders were quite bared to the flesh 
But I had<br>
not hitherto shaken the triangle ; a display of feeling which, it seems, was 
eagerly expected from me. To accelerate that spectacle a wire cat was 
introduced, armed with straps of tin or lead.<br>
. . . Whatever were its appendages, I cannot easily forget the power of it. In 
defiance of shame my waistband was cut for the finishing strokes of this 
lacerating instrument. The very</p>
<p align="justify"><b>264 FENIAN HEROES AND MARTYRS.</b></p>
<p align="justify"><br>
first lash, as it renewed all my pangs, and shot convulsive agony through my 
entire frame, made me shake the triangle indeed. A second infliction of it 
penetrated my loins, and tore them excruciatingly ; the third maintained the 
tremulous exhibition long enough—the spectators were satisfied.&quot;<br>
<br>
After detailing the several means to which the officers—commissioned and 
non-commissioned—had recourse, in order to force from him a confession of<br>
guilt, Father O'Neill proceeds :</p>
<blockquote>
	<p align="justify"><br>&quot; After I had answered him (one of the officers) in the corner of the ball-alley 
that I would suffer any death rather than acknowledge a crime whereof I was not 
guilty, he told me that I should be set at liberty if I would agree to a certain 
proposal which he then made ; but justice and truth commanded me to reject it. 
When conducted to jail, after a lapse of three hours, I was presented with a 
refreshment. It appeared to be wine and water, but must have had some other 
powerful ingredient, for it speedily brought on a stupor. The same officer soon 
roused me from my . lethargy, with a renewed effort to extort this avowal from 
me ; he drew his sword ; he declared he would never depart from me until it was 
given in writing ; he threatened that I should forthwith be led out again, 
flogged as before, shot, hanged, my head cut off to be exposed on the jail-top, 
and my body thrown into the river ; that he would allow me but two minutes to 
determine. Then, going to the door, he called for a scrip of paper, while the 
sentinel swore terribly at the same time that he would blow my brains out if I 
persisted any longer in my refusal. Under this impression I scribbled a note to 
my brother, which they instantly cried out was what they wanted ; the precise 
expressions of it I do not at this moment recollect ; it purported a wish that 
my brother might no longer indulge uneasiness on my account, for I deserved what 
I got. The officer withdrew ; my sister-in-law then got admittance : she told me 
she had just heard the sentinel say that during my entire punishment, nothing 
was against me ; however, that the paper I</p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify"><br>
<b>CROWLEY, KELLY AND M'CLURE. 265</b></p>
<blockquote>
	<p align="justify"><br>had just written would assuredly hang me. I exclaimed that their ' dreadful 
threats had compelled me to write it, which exclamation being carried to the 
officer, he returned the next day ; he called me to the jail window commanding a 
view of the gallows, whereon two men were hanging, their bodies so bloody that I 
imagined they were red-jackets. A third halter remained yet unoccupied, which he 
declared was intended for me, should I persist in disclaiming the aforesaid 
note. Look,' said he, at those men ; look at that rope ; your treatment shall be 
worse than theirs if you disown what you wrote yesterday ; ' adding that it was 
still in my power to get free. I imagined from this that he wanted money from 
me, or a favorite mare which I had occasionally lent him. My answer was—' If you 
liberate me, you shall always find me thankful, there is nothing in my power 
that I will not do.' Do not attempt, then,' said he, 'to exculpate yourself,' 
and then retired. I now procured paper whereon I wrote a formal protest against 
what he had extorted from me as above ; that, should I be executed, this protest 
might appear after my death.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify"><br>
After this martyr our hero had been named, and the granduncle was very much 
attached to his nephew. On Father O'Neill's death, young Peter inherited, under 
his will, all that the priest was worth hi the world, including his residence. 
The management of the property was assumed by Peter Crowley's eldest sister, 
who, some years his senior, endeavored to carry out faithfully the bequest of 
the deceased clergyman. Time rolled on, and Peter attaining his majority, worked 
with great energy on the farm which had been left to him, and, by industry and 
perseverance, soon converted it into a valuable property. He was always a man of 
exceedingly temperate habits, never having drunk a drop of spirituous liquor 
since be was ten years of age ; and when his day of toil was ended, he applied 
himself to study.</p>
<p align="justify">&nbsp;</p>
<p align="justify"><b>266 FENIAN HEROES AND MARTYRS,</b></p>
<p align="justify"><br>
Well versed in the history of his country, and deeply impressed by the dreadful 
punishment to which his granduncle had been subjected, he was imbued with 
feelings of the deepest hostility towards the English Government. Peter 
Crowley's grandfather was like- wise mixed up in the movement of '98, and for 
two years he was a proclaimed outlaw; in short, he was descended from rebels. It 
was natural for him to be national; and, joining the Fenian Brotherhood—of which 
he was a member for several years—he threw himself heart and soul into the 
movement, fostering its designs and extending its ramifications. Hs na- ture was 
high-toned and loveable. He was most worthy and excellent in his family 
relations—the best of brothers; and, rather than cause those with whom he lived 
any uneasiness, he was accustomed to steal out night, unobserve, with a view to 
forwarding the at cause which was so dear to his heart, returning in the morning 
to his work, apparently unfatigued by the loss of his night's rest. The blood of 
the martyrs was in him, and gave him strength.<br>
The second of this trio of heroes, John Edward Kelly, was born in Kinsale, 
County Cork, on the 6th July, 1840. His parents emigrated to Halifax when the 
child was but two years old. He went o school there, and when young, displayed a 
talent forts drawing, for proficiency in which he received a premium. When about 
fourteen years of age he removed to Boston, where he served an apprenticeship to 
the printing</p>
<p align="justify"><br>
<b>CROWLEY, KELLY AND M'CLURE. 267</b></p>
<p align="justify"><br>
business, at the expiration of which he came to New York, where he joined the 
Fenian Brotherhood, in the Spring of 1860. Being an enthusiast with practical 
ideas, he attached himself to the military department of the organization. He 
was one of the original members of the &quot; Phoenix Zouaves &quot;—a Company which, at 
that time, numbered among its members several young men who afterwards 
distinguished themselves on many a hard-fought field in the service of the 
Republic—chief among them being Colonels J. P. and Denis J. Downing, Captains 
John D. Hearne, William O'Shea, and Francis Welply. The two last-named heroes 
died on the battle-fields of Spottsylvania and Ream's Station ; and all the 
others were, more than once, severely wounded while attesting their devotion to 
the cause of human freedom.<br>
Under the tutelage of Captain Thomas Kiely—a splendid military instructor of the 
United States Army, and a whole-souled Irish patriot—Kelly soon became a 
proficient in the use of the rifle and bayonet. He was indefatigable in 
acquiring military knowledge—both theoretically and practically—and he was 
seldom without &quot; Hardee's Tactics&quot; in his pocket. In the winter of 1860, he went 
to Boston, and became instructor of the Emmet Guard, which was organized by the 
Brotherhood soon after his arrival. So highly were his services appreciated, 
that, on his expressing his desire to go to Ireland for the purpose of aiding 
his compatriots there in making preparations for the work before them, his 
friends in Boston insisted on defraying his expenses home.</p>
<p align="justify"><b>268 FENIAN HEROES AND MARTYRS.</b></p>
<p align="justify"><br>
After remaining a few days with his old comrades in New York, he sailed for 
Ireland in the month of April, 1861. Since that time, up to the outbreak in 
March, 1867, he resided principally in Cork, where his services, in imparting 
military instruction- to the young patriots of that city and its vicinity, under 
harrassing difficulties, will be long fondly remembered.<br>
Mr. Kelly opposed the proposition for the Emmet Guard to volunteer into the 
American service, believing they would be wanting immediately in Ireland. But 
when in Ireland, and seeing the tendency of events, he was a most earnest 
advocate of the Union cause. Kelly, it appears, never had much faith in aid from 
America, always contending that the men in Ireland were able to work out their 
own freedom ; and it was only, says his most intimate associate, &quot; after the 5th 
March, 1867, when he saw all the branches broken for want of a common trunk or 
centre to rally upon, that he admitted that an expedition from America was 
necessary for success.&quot; After his arrival in Dublin, he put himself in communion 
with the authorities of the I. R. B., and went to Cork, where he obtained work 
and made friends, even with Orangemen, who were employed in the same 
establishment. He subsequently went to London, but, disgusted with England and 
the English, returned to Dublin, and obtained employment on the Irish People 
when that journal was started. Here his talents were observed, and he was sent 
to Cork as an agent of the organization. He soon
raised a company, and was commissioned a &quot; B.&quot; During this period, his means 
were often at a low ebb,</p>
<p align="justify"><br>
<b>CROWLEY, KELLY AND M'CLURE.&nbsp; 269</b></p>
<p align="justify"><br>
but he found welcome and a home in the family of Mr.
and Mrs. John Buckley, devoted Fenians, now residents of Malden, Massachusetts. 
He was fond of alluding to the fact that, while suffering from a severe fever, 
he, a Protestant, experienced the greatest care from the good Sisters of Mercy 
and priests in Cork.<br>
Mr. Kelly's duties now took him constantly from Cork to Dublin, and he escaped 
arrest, on (he seizure of the Irish People, by having been just ordered to the 
former. The latter part of 1865 found him still organizing in Cork, and 
encouraging the people, while the appalling scenes of the first Special 
Commission were being enacted around him. He always worked with such 
systematized caution, that he could venture on bolder undertakings than even 
those who were less known. At this time Thomas B. Hennessy, and a few of the 
Boston men, arrived, to participate in the expected struggle. Kelly took them 
around the city, showing them the fortifications and strategetical points. It 
was about this same time that, as Mr. Hennessy writes, &quot; a batch of Western 
officers left Cork, recalled by Mr. Scanlan. Their defection caused the utmost 
depression in Cork; and Kelly took his Boston friends to the meetings of the 
Brotherhood, and, introducing them to the different officers, assured them that 
numbers of others were on their way over. This action contributed, in a great 
measure, to re-assure the Centres, who were beginning to get disheartened when 
they saw the men on whom they depended for leaders deserting them.&quot;<br>
After undergoing many privations in Dublin and</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Liverpool in 1866, we find Kelly, in the Fall of that year, 
engaged as a printer on the Cork <i>Herald, </i>still keeping up the discipline 
of his men, although he had misgivings as to any movement taking place. Among 
the nationalists of Cork &quot;Kelly's Men &quot; were known as the <i>avant-garde--all &quot;
</i>dare devils like himself.&quot; He was only dissuaded from going to aid the Kerry 
rising, in February, by being reminded that he had &quot; no orders ;&quot; but he made 
his mind up to make a certain 'movement to rally the people, if the leaders gave 
no sign of action.</font></p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Times New Roman">On the Saturday before the 
rising, he called on Crowley, who was in the city, and, taking a walk with him 
and Hennessy, unfolded his plans to them. Crowley thought them rash ; but 
Kelly's eloquence finally won Crowley's consent, who agreed to take part in them 
if something else did not occur. That &quot; something&quot; was the rising of the 5th. 
Crowley, grasping Hennessy's hand; said : &quot; Mr. Hennessy, when we meet again it 
will be on the battle-field !&quot; Hennessy promised to join Kelly's plans, but he 
was assigned to other duties, with the Cork forces, by Massey. He never saw 
Crowley again. .</font></p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Times New Roman">The youngest of the Kilcloony 
heroes is John McClure, who was born 17th July, 1846, at Dobbs Ferry, 
Westchester County, State of New York. His parents were both Irish, his father, 
David McClure, being a native of Tipperary, and his mother, who was of the 
O'Donnell sept, hailing from Limerick County. They had emigrated to this country 
several years before, and were in respectable circumstances when John was</font></p>
<font FACE="Times New Roman">
<p align="left"><b>CROWLEY, KELLY AND M<sup>'</sup>CLURE. 271.</b></font></p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Times New Roman">born. He was their fifth child, 
and growing tip amid th<sup>e</sup> simple scenes of country life, imbibed its 
virtues, and surrounded by the magnificence of Nature, acquired its innate 
nobility. When able to learn, he was sent to the &quot; district&quot; school of the 
place, from which he derived a plain English education. He continued at school 
until about sixteen years of age, when he came to New-York City, and, under the 
guidance and advice of his elder brother, William James, he obtained a very 
desirable clerkship, in which occupation he gave satisfaction to his employers. 
At this time the American civil war was at its height, and the idiosyncrasies of 
the lad began to exhibit themselves. On the morning of December 5th, 1863, he 
was missing from his post ; nothing was known of his whereabouts until a note 
from him, of the 10th inst., stated that he was bound for Washington, having 
enlisted as private in the 11th N. Y. V. Cavalry, (&quot; Scott's 900.&quot;) The efforts 
of his family to have him return home were unavailing, and so he entered the 
theatre of war. </font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">After some months of duty at Washington, part of 
the time being employed as clerk in the Court Martial Rooms there, he embarked 
with his regiment on board a transport ship for New Orleans, where they were 
quartered, making occasional incursions into the Confederate country, and 
checking the guerillas, who were rampant. Eventually his regiment was removed up 
the Mississippi river, and many were the raids made • by John and his comrades 
for supplies ; and many hard rides and skirmishes he experienced through Mis-</font></p>
<p align="justify"><b>272 FENIAN HEROES AND MARTYRS.</b></p>
<p align="justify"><br>
sissippi, Arkansas and Tennessee—now foraging, now overawing the guerillas. It 
was a wild and merry life, with but little of bitterness in it ; and it is a 
fact that young McClure was never engaged in any of the pitched battles of the 
war. He was appointed quartermaster sergeant of his company, (&quot; L &quot;) and 
subsequently quartermaster sergeant of Company &quot;B &quot; The war ended, and the 
troops marched home. John's regiment was mustered out at Memphis, Tenn., and 
discharged at Albany, N. Y. On a bright day, early in October, he walked into 
his brother's place of business much the same kindly lad as he was twenty-two 
months before, having doffed his military gear at Albany, and purchased a 
civilian's dress, &quot;more serviceable than elegant.&quot; Again he took up the pen, and 
labored very constantly for over a year.<br>
The strength of the Fenian organization had been great, its hopes high, its 
disasters many, and in the Winter of '66-7 it arrived at the most ominous period 
of its vicissitudes. Young McClure never by act or word expressed any special 
predilection for the movement, and it was not until two days before his 
departure for the British Isles, that his family knew of his determination to 
cast himself into the breach, and make one of the forlorn hope of Irish 
patriotism. There is no doubt but that he was influenced to this course by 
association with some of the Fenian leaders, who met together occasionally at 
the house where he resided. Their anticipations were bright as their designs 
were daring, and awoke the youth's susceptible spirit of adventure. On the 18th 
day of December,</p>
<p align="justify"><br>
<b>CROWLEY, KELLY AND M'CLURE. 273</b></p>
<p align="justify"><br>
1866, he set sail, with his older and more experienced Fenian companions, for 
the scene of Irish insurrection. They arrived at Glasgow, Scotland, early in 
January, and scattered to different parts. McClure went from Glasgow to 
Liverpool, and thence to Cork, from which latter city he wrote to his brother in 
New York sub-ram, about the middle of February, that, notwithstanding the 
failure of the F. B. in America in arming their brothers at home, they were 
resolved to precipitate the death-struggle for independence with the scanty 
weapons at hand. He was appointed to command the Middleton District, in Cork 
County.<br>
Such were the antecedents of the three gallant spirits, whose lives had become 
so honorably united in a common purpose.<br>
On the night of the 5th March, Shrove Tuesday, a large body of men, armed with 
rifles, guns, revolvers, pikes and scythes, assembled at a given point, and 
arrayed in military order, they proceeded—according to a preconcerted plan—to 
the Knockadoon coastguard station. Captain McClure was in command of this party, 
and made one of the most successful of the insurgent attacks.<br>
After sacking Knockadoon coastguard station, the party proceeded to Killeagh, 
and were to have joined the Middleton and Castlemartyr contingents. By a 
mistake—which could only be accounted for by the loss of their leader, Timothy 
Daly, who was killed—the latter party did not meet the former ; who, tired of 
waiting, proceeded direct to the Tipperary mountains. Returning from the Galtees, 
the Ballymacoda con-</p>
<p align="justify"><b>274 FENIAN HEROES AND MARTYRS.</b><br>
tingent (which tenaciously held together, notwithstanding some defections, 
settled down in a remote part near Mitchelstown. Here in the defiles and gorges 
of the chain of mountains which extends beyond Fermoy, towards Mitchelstown,. 
the insurgents passed their time. Some days before the fatal encounter, having 
been made aware that the Waterford flying column were on their trail, they 
changed their position, and separated into small knots, with a view of being 
better able to elude the vigilance of their pursuers. It is stated that Crowley 
was in Cork the Thursday prior to the affray ; and that, disguised as a carman, 
he was enabled to avoid detection. We are also told that the men had ample means 
of escape to France or other places, but, indulging in the hope that aid would 
come sooner or later, they determined to the last to stand by the cause which 
they had embraced, and which they were confident would succeed.<br>
The exact circumstances under which Crowley was in the wood, may not be without 
interest. By prearrangement, a friend of his (who was in full possession of his 
whereabouts all through) was to have met him at Kilclooney Wood on Sunday, March 
31, or following day, for the purpose of supplying him with some essentials. 
Scouts anxiously watched, lest their visitor should by possibility pass unseen. 
It is supposed that they were observed, and that information was in the meantime 
conveyed to the authorities. Acting on this or other information, the resident 
Magistrate of Mitchelstown—Mr. Neale Browne—collected the district constabulary, 
and sent a requisition for the assistance of</p>
<p align="justify"><br>
<b>CROWLEY, KELLY AND M'CLURE. 275</b></p>
<p align="justify"><br>
the County Waterford Column. This was composed of a troop of the Sixth 
Carbineers, two companies of the Sixth Warwickshire infantry, some of the 
military train, and Royal Engineers—in all about one hundred and twenty 
men—commanded by Major Bell. Guided by Mr. Browne, Mr. Redmond, resident 
Magistrate of Dungarvan, and Sub-Inspector Rudge, the troops reached the 
romantic valley of Aharfoucha at day-dawn on Sunday morning.. Here the collision 
took place. Here Crowley, Kelly and McClure resisted the combined forces ; and 
the military are said to have been greatly impressed by their extraordinary 
pluck and determination.<br>
A stream flows through the valley of Aharfoucha, towards the banks of which 
Kilclooney Wood slopes down. Forty men, commanded by Major Bell, surrounded it 
on the south and west sides, in skirmishing order ; the cavalry were posted 
higher up in the valley, while the constabulary took possession of the Western 
Mountain, and the carbineers surrounded the houses on the east. The skirmishers 
were directed to let no one escape from the wood. One of them, perceiving a 
figure moving among the trees, challenged ; a shot was the reply. The order was 
then given to advance into the wood, and a sharp fusilade commenced. Finding 
their hiding-place thus invaded, two of the Fenians who had been concealed, made 
a rush for the river, firing rapidly at the soldiers as they emerged from the 
trees. The military returned the fire with vigor.<br>
At this moment Mr. Redmond dashed through the</p>
<p align="justify"><b>276 FENIAN HEROES AND MARTYRS.</b></p>
<p align="justify"><br>
military lines, under fire, in pursuit of the fugitives. He overtook Captain 
McClure as the latter reached the river, and grappled with Min from behind. 
McClure tried to shoot Mr. Redmond over his shoulder, but in doing so he left 
himself open to the soldiers, who rushed up to bayonet him. Mr. Redmond 
commanded them to spare his life, and just succeeded in checking the direction 
of an outstretched rifle. They struggled for a short time in the water, but 
McClure was soon overpowered by numbers. His companion, Crowley, was more 
unfortunate; as he was also jumping into the river, some shots struck him and he 
fell mortally wounded. The soldiers plunged in after him, and drew him to the 
bank.<br>
It was found on examination that one of the shots had struck the lock of his 
musket, breaking the third finger of his right hand, and then rebounded, making 
a large welt across his stomach. Another shot had entered the middle of his 
back, and passed out through the right axilla. He was laid on the ground, while 
the surgeon tried to stanch the blood by pressure. As he lay on the grass, with 
his eyes devoutly raised to heaven, few (says one account) &quot; could withhold an 
expression of admiration and sympathy from one who had, in many respects, the 
qualities of a hero.&quot;<br>
Kelly was observed by Ensign Meredith crouching behind a ditch, rifle in hand ; 
he was summoned to surrender, and, seeing the uselessness of further resistance, 
threw down his gun, which was afterwards recognized as a coast-guard's weapon. 
He had a haversack containing a few pounds of raw pork, also</p>
<p align="justify"><br>
<b>CROWLEY, KELLY AND M'CLURE 277</b></p>
<p align="justify"><br>
some ammunition. In his pocket-book were several entries, headed as his &quot; 
journal of the campaign ;&quot; and the last entry, when five were together, was made 
on the 7th of March. He had also a green silk flag, with white fringe, a green 
handkerchief, and map of the County Cork.<br>
An elevating interest centres on the martyr-hero, farmer Crowley. The priest was 
sent for, and the military surgeon, Dr. Sugrue, who staunched his wounds, read 
the last prayer from Crowley's own prayer book, which he always carried about 
him. The dying man was conscious to the last. When asked how he was, he replied, 
&quot; I feel better now—you were about an hour too early ; if you were an hour later 
I would have given you a hot reception, and a very nice morning.&quot; What he 
intended to convey by the remark may not be obvious; but it was believed that 
the remainder of the party, who were not far off, had appointed to meet at Kilclooney Wood at six o'clock that morning. Had they been allowed an 
opportunity of concentrating in the plantation before the military assembled, 
there can be little doubt that a fierce and desperate encounter would have 
ensued. He had been conveyed on a litter to the nearest farm-house, but the 
people not wishing him to die there, he had to be taken to Mitchelstown, where 
lie received attention and spiritual consolation.<br>
The last moments of the wounded insurgent were most impressive. For half an hour 
before he succumbed, a clergyman was present, ministering to the dying man the 
consolations of religion; and the rev-</p>

erend gentleman, writing to a friend, describes him in the following terms : 
&quot;His death was most edifying. Never did I attend one who made a greater 
impression upon me. He begged of me to tell his sister not to be troubled 
because of his death, which he hoped would be a happy one.&quot; The body of the 
deceased had been removed to the workhouse, and when it became known who it was, 
a large crowd collected outside the gate of the union, and insisted upon getting 
the remains, in order that it might receive the last rites in proper form. When 
the sister of the deceased arrived, she had some difficulty in obtaining 
admittance, owing to the commotion outside. The martyr was laid out in his &quot; 
habit&quot; in the dead-house, and the loving sister immediately recognized her 
brother. Her request to see his clothes that he wore on the fatal morning was 
complied with. They were the disguise which he had worn in his expedition, and 
she did not identify them as his own. The police endeavored to detain them, but 
Miss Crowley insisted upon claiming them. Besides the scapulars which he wore, 
he had also attached round his neck a large bronze crucifix and a little medal, 
the emblems of a Christian &quot; order.&quot; The crucifix was shattered in two places, 
and the medal was bent, plainly indicating they had been struck by bullets. On 
the chest of the deceased, where the religious tokens had been worn, there was 
an indentation in the skin corresponding with the size of the medal, as if it 
had violently pressed against that part of the breast.<br>
An inquest was held the next day, and the jury, af-</p>

ter exhibiting some doubt, as to the right of such a large body of men firing on 
three fugitives, ultimately returned a verdict of death from the effects of a 
gunshot wound inflicted by the military while in the discharge of their duty.<br>
The funeral took place on Tuesday, the 2d April, and awakened the strongest 
feelings of sympathy. About one hundred women and children, each carrying 
branches of laurel, formed a procession four deep ; then followed a. scattered 
group of female friends ; next the hearse. The coffin was strewn with branches 
of laurel. The sister of the patriot walked after the coffin as chief mourner, 
her head covered with a dark hood, and being supported by three priests. The 
love in which Crowley was held by his neighbors, and their sympathy for his 
hero-death, was exhibited by the closing of all the shops in the town. At Fermoy, 
during the interval that elapsed for resting the horses, the plumes and hearse 
were decorated with ribbons and green boughs, and a representation of the Irish 
harp was placed on one of the panels of the hearse. For miles the coffin was 
borne on men's shoulders ; and it was only when the &quot;shades of evening&quot; had 
fallen, that the corpse was placed in the hearse. The following day the remains 
were removed from his late residence to the place .of interment at Ballymacoda. 
In consequence of a request previously made by the relatives of the deceased, 
there was not a renewal of Tuesday's demonstration ; but the mournful procession 
which followed the corpse expressed their sorrow and regret for the deceased in 
another and more pathetic</p>
<p align="justify"><b>280 FENIAN HEROES AND MARTYRS.</b></p>

form. Among the persons who attended the funeral a large body of stalwart, yet 
respectable young men, were present. After the burial requiem had been chanted, 
and the prayers of the people offered for the soul of the departed, all that was 
mortal of Peter Crowley was deposited in the earth, amid the sorrow and weeping 
of some, and deep expressions of vengeance from others.<br>
Crowley's comrades, McClure and Kelly, were conveyed to Cork Jail, and were 
arraigned at the Special Commission held in that city on Monday, 21st May, 1867, 
by Chief Justice Monaghan, Justice Keogh, and Justice George. Their appearance 
in the dock is thus described: &quot; The demeanor in court of Edward Kelly, as well 
as that of Captain McClure, was marked by an air of the most complete and unassumed indifference. When called on to plead, each rose from his seat, and in 
a gentlemanly, firm manner, answered &quot; not guilty.&quot; Kelly and McClure looked 
remarkably well, and appeared to enjoy the change of scene from the cell to the 
dock. No one, looking at them in a casual way, would suspect them of having 
taken a part in a most daring and memorable incident of the late insurrection. 
They are accused of being two of the three men whose bravery, when surrounded by 
the soldiers and police in Kilclooney Wood, called forth the admiration of the 
military. The third of that brave trio—Peter Crowley—was shot dead whilst 
attempting to cross the river which outskirts the wood. Looking at the boyish 
face of Kelly, and the almost equally youthful and quiet countenance of McClure,</p>
<p align="justify"><br>
<b>CROWLEY, KELLY AND M'CLURE. 281</b></p>
<p align="justify"><br>
one could scarcely be convinced how they could have possessed so much pluck and 
endurance as they, admittedly, displayed.&quot; <br>
On the third day of his trial, McClure was induced, after persistent persuasions 
on the part of the U. S. Consul, Eastman, and his solicitor, to plead guilt', 
with the &quot; distinct understanding that the United States Government would 
interpose for his release on giving security to leave the country.&quot; On the same 
day Kelly was found guilty. On the next day, Friday, 25th May, they were put 
forward and, the Clerk of the Crown having formally asked McClure if lie had 
anything to say why sentence of death should not be passed upon him, the 
prisoner rose in the dock, and resting his hands on the front of it, addressed 
the Court in a loud, calm, manly voice. He said :</p>
<blockquote>
	<p align="justify"><br>
	&quot;My lords, in answer to the question as to why the sentence of the court 
	should not now be passed upon me, I would desire to make a few remarks in 
	relation to my late exertions on behalf of the suffering people of this 
	country—in aiding them in their earnest endeavors to obtain the independence 
	of their native land. Although not born on the soil of Ireland, my parents 
	were, and from history, and the traditions of the fireside, I became 
	conversant with this country's miseries from my earliest childhood; and as 
	the human breast possesses those Godlike attributes which make men feel for 
	suffering mankind, I felt for Ireland's wrongs, and for her moral 
	degradation, and I felt that I should assist her people in their attempt to 
	right those wrongs and raise her from degradation. I shall not now state to 
	what cause I attribute the failure of the late insurrectionary movement. Nor 
	shall I express a sorrow I do not feel with regard to my own conduct. I am 
	fully satisfied of the righteousness of my every act in connection with the 
	late revo-</p>

	desire to assist in the emancipation of an enslaved but generous people. It 
	affords me more pleasure to have acted as I have done in behalf of the Irish 
	people, than any event that has occurred to me during my eventful, though 
	youthful existence. I would wish it to be distinctly understood—and I say it 
	here standing on the brink of an early grave—that I am no fillibuster or 
	freebooter. I came to this country with no personal object to gain—with no 
	desire to my own advancement. I came here solely out of love of Ireland and 
	sympathy for her people. If I have forfeited my life in having done so, I am 
	ready to abide the issue. If my devotion to an oppressed people be a crime, 
	I am willing to receive the penalty of that crime, knowing, as I do, that 
	what I have done was in behalf of a people whose cause was just and holy—a 
	people who will appreciate and honor a man, although he may not be a 
	countryman of their own, but still a man who is willing to suffer in defence 
	of that divine American principle—the right of self-government. I would now 
	wish to tender to my learned and eloquent counsel, Mr. Heron and Mr. Waters, 
	and to my solicitor, Mr. Collins, my sincere and heartfelt thanks for the 
	able manner in which they have conducted my defence. And now, my lords, I

	<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;My lords, the novelty of my situation will plead for any

	necessarily tedious. I thank the jury for their kind recommendation to 
	mercy, which I know is well meant, but also knowing, as I do, what that

	Father. I do not recollect having in my life injured a human being

	political conduct. Why then, I say, should I fear death. I leave the dread 
	of death to such despicable wretches as Corydon and Massey. Corydon a name

	the Psalmist, premising that you will understand me to speak of my country 
	as he speaks of his' If I forget thee, O Jerusalem, let my right hand forget 
	her cunning. If I do not remember thee, let my tongue cleave to the roof of 
	my mouth ; if I prefer not Jerusalem above my chief joy. Remember, O Lord, 
	the children of Edom in the day of Jerusalem, who said—Raize it, raize it, 
	even to the foundation thereof. O daughter of Babylon, who art to be 
	destroyed, happy shall be he that rewardeth thee as thou hast served us.' In

The prisoner then sat down. At that part of his address where he referred, in 
terms so apropos, to the informer, Corydon, the soft and serene expression which 
his face hitherto wore, changed, and his eyes flashed scornfully and wrathfully. 
After the interruption of the court, he paused for a while, and then, in a voice 
of deep emotion, and with an air of sudden inspiration, he repeated the 
beautiful words of the Psalmist, &quot;And his soul went forth with them;&quot; and when 
he had concluded the quotation and lowered his eyes, he appeared exhausted from 
the rush of thought and feeling which the words produced. As he repeated the 
psalm, the Chief Justice leant his head on the bench and appeared deeply 
moved—in fact very few eyes in the court-house were dry. Sentence of death was 
then pronounced.</p>

<p align="justify"><br>
McClure is about five feet seven inches in height, light and active, with dark 
complexion, and reserved manners. In social life he was generous, good-natured 
and temperate. As a member of the New York Mercantile Library Association here, 
the books he usually applied for were on military and kindred subjects. His 
chief study, just before he espoused the Irish cause, was &quot; Campaigns of 
Napoleon,&quot; and Doheny's &quot; Felon's Track.&quot;<br>
Kelly is about five feet six inches in height, slightly but compactly built, with 
a fair complexion, oval face and blue eyes. He was &quot;a swift and clean 
compositor,&quot; a proficient French scholar, and had a habit of insisting on 
everything being done well and to the minute. His temperament is highly 
poetical, and he possesses considerable literary talent. Among his other 
avocations in New York he was writing a tragedy, and had it nearly completed, 
when his passion for military knowledge absorbed all his faculties. He was 
brought up in the Protestant faith; but his joining his comrades in the &quot;Rosary 
of the Blessed Virgin &quot; during their lonely vigils in Kilclooney Wood, shows how 
little he was actuated by religious prejudices.</p>
