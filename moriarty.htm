		<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify"><b>Mortimer Moriarty is 
		a native of the Parish of Cahirciveen, County of Kerry; and emigrated 
		with his family to Toronto, Canada West, after the famine of 1846-7. The 
		memories of the sufferers in the old land kept alive his patriotism in 
		the new. He became a prominent member of the St. Patrick's and Hibernian 
		Societies ; and went still further, in becoming the first organizer of 
		Fenianism in Canada. His military tendencies led him to the command of a 
		company of militia; and he was arrested, with that sturdy nationalist, 
		Mr. Michael Murphy, and others, when on his way to join the armed

		and, after further adventures, reached New York. Captain Moriarty sailed 
		for Ireland in December, 1866, and was despatched by Col. T. J. Kelly to 
		take O'Connor's place in Kerry, in the belief that the latter, according 
		to report, had been captured.</b></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify"><b>Meeting O'Connor, he 
		was induced to remain in charge of the locality surrounding Cahirciveen;

		of the Solicitor-General, who traced up Moriarty's movements in these 
		words : &quot;From Christmas, 1866, till February, he lived at Connor's, and 
		had no ostensible employment whatever. He made frequent visits to 
		Cahirciveen, and said he came to Ireland for the benefit of his health. 
		In Cahirciveen there is a reading-room, where dances are frequently 
		held, and I think I am justified in stating it was used not only for the 
		purposes of innocent recreation, but as a place where Fenians resorted. 
		On the evening of the 11th of February, Moriarty was at the dance there 
		with O'Reilly, who had been convicted as a Fenian at these assizes. 
		About the first of February, J. J. O'Connor was stopping at the house of 
		a man named Kelly, a quarter of a mile from where Moriarty was living.

		distinctive features were described, he having lost a portion of the 
		nose in the recent American war. Unfortunately, he had on his person 
		papers from O'Connor, introducing him to Sheehan as deputy for that 
		part, and prescribing an immediate plan of action. At least so the story 
		is told. Sheehan was, of course, arrested, and, with Captain Moriarty 
		and a man named Garde, conveyed to Tralee jail. The same night the wires 
		of the telegraph were cut simultaneously at two places, forty miles 
		assunder—ten miles to the east of Killarney, and twenty-eight miles to 
		the west, on the Valentia line. The coast-guard station, at Kells, was 
		attacked, and the arms found therein seized, but no in- jury done to the 
		men. Next day and night the magistrates met, panic-stricken, at the 
		Railway Hotel, Killarney, and kept telegraphing, like very furies, to 
		Dublin and Cork for more troops.' And so troops have arrived—arrived 
		next day from both places, to the amount now in all of one thousand, and

		was then taken to an adjacent house, when, fearing he was about to die, 
		he called for the priest. One of the party—call them insurgents' for the
