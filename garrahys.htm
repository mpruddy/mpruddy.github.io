<p><b>Notes for John Garrahy:</b></p>

<p><b>According to the History of Renville County: John Garrahy left County Clare, Ireland
abt 1857 and spent 8 years in Liverpool, England. From there John came to Massachusetts in
1865. John went first to Waseca County then to Renville county in July of 1868 with his
Brother-in-Law, Dennis Cready (later in the article called Grady) [since Cready was a
Brother-in-Law, John either married a Cready girl, or Dennis married John's sister and,
since Cready's wife lived with them in a dugout on Cready's land the first year, it might
be that Cready's wife was John Garrahy's Sister.--M.R.] This was confirmed by Elaine5
Murphy (Mary4 (Garrahy) Murphy, Patrick W.3, John2, Patrick1 Garrahy). John's sister's
name was Anne.</b></p>

<p><b>John settled the North Half of of the SE 1/4 of section 32. and his family came in
1869. Cready's wife was with him and he and his wife and John Garrahy settled on the NE
1/4 of Section 30 Wellington Township was organized June 4, 1874 and an election was held
at William Carson's home on June 17. William Carson was elected Chairman and Henry Barton
was Clerk.</b></p>

<p><b>Annie Garrahy Maxwell was one of, if not the first, woman to have a driver's license in
Minnesota.</b></p>

<p><b>The Garrahy's were among the first subscibers to the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, MN.</b></p>
