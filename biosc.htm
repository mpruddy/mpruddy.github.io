        on December 21, 1836. He emigrated to the United States
        and lived in Chautauqua County, New York and Homer,
        Michigan. Joseph married Mary Leonard at Homer on
        December 21, 1858. He was a harness maker. Mary died in
        1861 and Joseph enlisted in the Michigan Cavalry in 1862.
        He spent 3 years with this unit serving as a saddler and
        was discharged on July 1, 1865. After the war he moved
        back to Chautauqua County, New York where he married
        Ellen Trusler at Sinclairville. He continued his
        occupation as a harness makerand shopkeeper. The couple
        had five children. He died on January 27, 1918 at age 81
        and is buried in Sinclairville.<br>
        <br>
        When Joseph enlisted in the Union Army in 1862, he was 25
        years old, 5 feet 8 inches tall, with fair complexion,
        light brown hair, and blue grey eyes. He enlisted on
        August 9, 1862 in Jackson, Michigan for a period of 3
        years and was mustered into Company I, 4th Regiment of

        private and a saddler by occupation. He received a $25
        bounty.<br>
        <br>
        Military pay records show that he was present throughout
        the war although company records are missing from May
        through August 1864 and from September through December
        1864. On October 28, 1863 he was shown detached to
        Nashville, Tennessee for horses and on April 26, 1865 he
        was shown detached to Corps Headquarters. All other times
        show he was with the unit when role was recorded every 2
        months. He was mustered out of service on July 1, 1865 at
        Nashville, Tennessee.<br>
        <br>

        President to Macon, Georgia on May 13, 1865. Joseph
        received a 13 day pass beginning on May 13, 1865 from the

        Davis wagons and brought it home with him after the war.
        The family donated the pen to a Jamestown, New York
        museum in his memory.<br>
        <br>
        In 1890 Joseph first filed for a Civil War pension citing
        &quot;piles and hemorrhoids&quot; caused by riding with
        the cavalry in Georgia! It appears he was denied a
        pension until about 1904 when he became eligible because
        of age. When he died he was receiving a pension of $30
        per month. Ellen received a widow's pension of $30 per
        month beginning in 1918 until her death in 1921.<br>
        <br>
        Joseph's brother, John, served 3 years with Battery G,
        1st Regiment, Ohio Light Artillery. Joseph said that his
        favorite camp song was &quot;Tenting on the Old Camp
        Ground.&quot;<br>
        <br>
