	<p align="justify"><strong><font size="4">Around 1853-4 THOMAS Ruddy, JAMES
    Ruddy and NICHOLAS Ruddy were found in Allamakee County, Iowa.&nbsp; </font></strong></p>
	<p align="justify"><strong><font size="4">In 1865 MICHAEL Ruddy and his
    family arrived in Fairview Township in Allamakee County, Iowa. My search for the origin of the family began in 1997.<br>
	<br>
	Other than that they were born and died in Ireland, nothing is known of 
	Daniel and Ann [?] Ruddy the progenitors of at least two&nbsp; and maybe 
	other Ruddy families which located in Allamakee, County, Iowa. Their 
	children, JAMES M &amp; MICHAEL, and (perhaps children) THOMAS and NICHOLAS, are known Ruddy surname immigrants
    Allamakee County, Iowa. There are several 
	others of this surname [Ready, Ruddy, Reddy] in the area of Cherry Hill but 
	no connection has been established and no mention of the Cherry Hill Ruddy 
	Reddy etc. families was made 
	during the trip Michael and Catherine's grandson Michael Joseph Ruddy made to
    Iowa, Minnesota, and Illinois to visit his relatives, a trip which his children 
	funded. Michael Joseph did visit family in Allamakee Iowa, Fairfax 
	Minnesota and Chicago Illinois which tied this family together as a unit. 
	Robert Coleman, son in law of James M Ruddy, also gave instances of these 
	families being connected as well as newspaper articles and census data. </font></strong></p>

	        was born in Westport. Without any further information Westport is pretty
	        certain to be the area they lived before emigrating to Liverpool. Kilmeena Parish is a possible area from which the Ruddy family originated
	        based on other research explained elsewhere.&nbsp;</big></strong>&nbsp;</font></strong></p>

	  marriage in Westport Oughaval church on April 12, 1836 between Michael Ruddy
	  and Catherine Gibbons was witnessed by Patrick Ruddy and Mary Gibbons. Mary
	  is the name of a sister of Catherine Gibbons who, if it be her, was, by 1855, living in New York
	  - could this be Catherine's sister? Another enclave of Ruddy's existed about 30 miles North and a bit West
	  in Kilfian Parish where an instance of the rare name Nicholas Ruddy is also
	  found although the pronunciation of Clifton and Kilfian do not sound the
	  same, one should not discount the possibility of someone thinking they heard
	  the well known town of &quot;Clifden&quot; when the person actually said
	  &quot;Kilfian&quot;.</strong> <br>
	  MICHAEL Ruddy and his wife Catherine Gibbons [maiden name was found in the 
	  1841 birth record of their son John in Liverpool, England]. This led to the
	  discovery of the marriage in Oughaval Church, Westport, County Mayo of
	  Michael Ruddy and Catherine Gibbons&nbsp; This family is in 
	  the 1841 Census of Liverpool showing Thomas age 4, John age 11 Weeks. This 
	  family arrived to New York on the ship Powhattan April 25, 1842 where they 
	  are listed as Michael Ready wife Hannah [should be Catherine] sons John age 
	  1 and Thomas age 4. They are found under the name Michael Dudy in the 1850 
	  New York City Census along with Mary Ann their daughter born in New York, 
	  John does not appear in the 1850 census and maybe died between 1842-1850. The 
	  family are found in 
	  the Syracuse, New York in the 1855 census under Michael Reedy with sons Thomas born 
	  in Liverpool, 
	  Richard born in New York City and Daniel born in Syracuse. They are found in 
	  the Syracuse, New York US Census of 1860 with their children (Maryann age 14, Richard 
	  age 9, and Daniel age 5). This is two years prior to the family's move to Fairview Township, 
	  Allamakee County, Iowa.&nbsp; Thomas is not shown because, at age 21, he signed up for duty in New Mexico 
	  with the 5th US Army Regular Infantry regiment where he remained until he enlisted 
	  in the 2nd Wisconsin Cavalry during the Civil War. On January 4, 1865 JAMES 
	  M Ruddy sold half his farm to MICHAEL for $1.00. MICHAEL and his family 
	  appear in the Fairview, Allamakee County, Iowa 1870 US near to JAMES M and 
	  his family.</font></strong></p>
<p align="justify"><strong><font size="4">Another breakthrough was finding
    that Catherine's brother Thomas Gibbons emigrated to New York and became a
    school teacher there. He opened up several accounts in the Emigrant Savings
    Bank the entries in the Savings Bank allowed me to conclude he was Catherine's brother.
    This provided more evidence that they came from Westport in addition to the
    wedding location.<br>
	<br>
	The Ruddy migration to Iowa apparently started when THOMAS Ruddy, age not 
	given, perhaps a brother of James and Michael, bought an 80 acre 
	farm in Fairview Township, Allamakee County, Iowa in 1854. THOMAS' 
	personal connection to MICHAEL and JAMES is not known. What is known is that Thomas died before December 
	of 1854 when James M Ruddy claimed his property as administrator of his will.<br>
	<br>
	The Ruddy family split up in Iowa in the 1870s. The JAMES M Ruddy and the 
	Murphy families moving on to Fairfax, Renville County, Minnesota, while 
	Michael and Catherine remained on their farm.<br>
	<br>
	NICHOLAS Ruddy, born about 1820, who may be related to the Ruddy's listed 
	above, shows up a few farms away from James M in the 1856 US Census as a farmer in the Fairview Township and later 
	Nicholas is seen in the 1860 and 1870 in Fairview as a 
	farm laborer. NICHOLAS died September 13, 1872 is buried in St Mary's 
	Cemetery in McGregor, Iowa. Nicholas, if he is connected, becomes a possible key to 
	exact 
	location of the Ruddy's in Ireland. There is only one place in Griffith's 
	Valuation where the name Nicholas Ruddy occurs and that is in Kilmeena 
	Parish north of Westport in County Mayo. The next step would be to go and try to find 
	Daniel and Ann's gravestones around Westport.</font></strong></p>

	<br>
	MICHAEL's son Richard married an Ellen Walsh and went to Chicago. MICHAEL 
	RUDDY and Catherine stayed on in Iowa then later joined their son Richard in 
	Chicago. MICHAEL and Catherine and their son Richard are buried at Calvary 
	Cemetery in Evanston, Illinois along with a infant child of Richard's. 
	MICHAEL's daughter Mary Ann married an O'Malley and moved to Roscoe in the 
	Dakota territory according to family members. She returned for the proving 
	of the will in 1873 as Mary Ann O'Malley. MICHAEL's son Daniel stayed in 
	Mendon in Clayton County Iowa. MICHAEL's son Daniel married [1] Annie Baker 
	in 1882 and she bore all of Daniel's children, but Annie died 10 years later in 
	1893. Daniel then married [2] Rose Lardner in 1894 and together they raised the 
	children in Iowa and, later, Chicago. Richard's daughter Gertrude moved to Chicago, then returned 
	to Allamakee in 1900 before moving to Fairfax, Renville County Minnesota 
	when James M Ruddy's son Michael brought her to Fairfax to teach school 
	there. In Fairfax she met 
	and married James Edward Garrahy. MICHAEL's older son Thomas at age 18, in 
	1857, [pretending he was 21] joined the US Infantry to go out 
	west and fight the Indians and he is found on the roster of this regiment in 
	Albuquerque, Bernalillo County, New Mexico in the 1860 US census. When the 
	Civil War began Thomas mustered out of the Regular Army enlisted in the 3rd 
	Wisconsin Volunteer Cavalry and served until the war ended in 1865. Thomas 
	joined his Ruddy family in Iowa after his discharge and in 1867 married Jane 
	Waters and settled down in McGregor, Clayton County, Iowa. His wife Jane 
	died in 1888 and he spent his last years in the National Old Soldier's home 
	in Milwaukee. Thomas' son Michael Joseph Ruddy married Bertha Lurena King 
	from West Chester, Washington County, Iowa. In 1901 Michael Joseph worked on the Railroad then 
	headed west. For a short time Michael Joseph and Bertha lived in Los 
	Angeles, finally relocating to Salt Lake City, Utah where they lived 
	out their days raising their children. MICHAEL RUDDY's brother JAMES M RUDDY married Ellen Murphy in 1857 
	in Saint Gabriel's church in Prairie du Chein, Wisconsin across the river 
	from JAMES M RUDDY's farm in Fairview Township in Allamakee, County, Iowa 
	where he farmed 
	his land. Thomas left him in Fairview, 
	Iowa where all his children, but one, were born. In 1872 JAMES M Ruddy and 
	his family moved from Iowa to Fairfax, Renville County, Minnesota where he 
	died in 1883. James' wife Ellen [Murphy] Ruddy died in 1903. JAMES M's son 
	Daniel (born Iowa) left Fairfax, Minnesota to return to the McGregor area in 
	Iowa then then spent the last part of his life in Minneapolis, MN where 
	he died in 1945. JAMES M's son Michael (born in Iowa) married Sarah Donnelly&nbsp; 
	in Fairfax, Minnesota and stayed on in Fairfax, MN. Sarah died early in 1899 and 
	Michael, Sarah's husband and JÁMES M's son, died in Minneapolis in 1949. JAMES M's son James Jr, met and married 
	on July 2, 1895 in Minneapolis, Anna Victoria McNulty of Wabasha County, MN, the 
	couple then moved to 
	Chicago where James jr. worked in the steel mills where he died January 7, 1904 at the age of 38 
	from lung congestion. James M's son Thomas Ruddy died on March 6, 1923 while 
	in the state asylum for the insane at Anoka, Minnesota. James Jr.'s wife Anna 
	[McNulty] Ruddy was brought back to Fairfax by James M's son Michael to live 
	in Fairfax and raise James' family after his death. Later Anna moved with 
	the children to Minneapolis to run a boarding house. Anna died in 
	Minneapolis January 17, 1963. Of JAMES M Ruddy's daughters, all but Ellen 
	were born in Iowa and 
	all got married in Fairfax, Minnesota. <br>&nbsp;</font></strong></p>

<p align="center"><strong><font size="4" color="#0000FF">The connection between Michael and James M 
Ruddy in Iowa</font></strong></p>
<p align="justify">&nbsp;</p>
<blockquote>
	<p align="justify"><font size="4"><b>A trip to Waukon the county seat of Allamakee 
County Iowa in June of 1996 uncovered land records showing my great grandfather 
James M Ruddy had acquired the land in Fairview Township in Allamakee County as 
a result of the death of a Thomas Ruddy in 1854. Three years later James M Ruddy 
married Ellen Murphy and their marriage registration in Prairie du Chein 
Wisconsin provided the names of James M Ruddy's&nbsp; parents Daniel and Ann Ruddy. 
The discovery of the sale for $1.00 of half of this land in 1865 to Michael and 
Catherine Ruddy, made it seem probable, along with their ages, that Michael Ruddy was the brother of 
James M. Ruddy. The establishment of Michael and James as brothers proves 
critical since Michael married Catherine in Ireland and thus this family could 
be traced with much more certainty than an unmarried James M Ruddy who could not be 
separated from all the other James Ruddy's found in genealogical sources. Robert 
Coleman, son of &quot;Great Aunt Mame&quot; Ruddy from Fairfax, gave the first bit of 
proof when he recounted that Gertrude Veronica Ruddy, grand daughter of Michael 
and Catherine Ruddy of Iowa, was a 'niece' of my great uncle Michael Ruddy, son of James M Ruddy, and that uncle Michael brought Gertrude from Iowa to 
teach school in Fairfax. Although 'niece' was not technically correct (Gertrude 
was a granddaughter of Michael and Catherine and great uncle Michael was a grand 
son of James M, so the relationship was more that of a cousin), still the 
connection grand niece is probable and established that Michael and Catherine of Iowa were relatives of 
James M and Ellen of Fairfax. It was four years later in March of 2000, a cold 
call was made to Dennis Barnett of Salt Lake City Utah who had married Dorothy 
Ruddy daughter Michael Joseph Ruddy, a grandson of Michael and Catherine. Dennis 
politely called his wife Kris to the phone who &quot;did the genealogy&quot; and Kris was 
able to supply photos documenting a trip Michael Joseph had made in 1941 to 
Iowa, Fairfax and Chicago which linked all of these families together. There was 
now solid proof of the connection between Michael and Catherine Ruddy of Iowa 
and James M and Ellen Ruddy of Fairfax. A newspaper clipping from an article in 
a Renville County, Minnesota&nbsp; paper supplied the another proof&nbsp; of 
this connection, wherein it stated that Michael Joseph Ruddy in 1905 went to 
retrieve the body of his brother Thomas Francis Ruddy who died in Minneapolis. 
Michael Joseph and Thomas Francis were both grandsons of Michael and Catherine. 
The article further stated that Michael Joseph and Thomas Francis were cousins 
of Michael and Daniel Ruddy of Fairfax sons of James M and Ellen Ruddy. The link 
now firmly established made the search for the birthplace of Michael and 
Catherine the key to discovering where the Ruddy's came from in Ireland. Next 
came the discovering of the 1836 birth of John Ruddy in Liverpool leading to 
Westport in County Mayo Ireland. A call received from Carol Odenwalder, of Utah, 
daughter-in-law of Michael Joseph's daughter Florence, revived the search again 
providing the much valuable information on the Michael Joseph branch of the 
family, including the fact that Michael Joseph's daughters had put together 
their savings to pay for Michael Joseph's trip to Minnesota, Iowa, and Illinois 
shortly before Michael Joseph died in 1947.&nbsp; That trip provided all the 
pictures connecting these descendants. Since James M Ruddy, in his marriage 
registration, had stated that he was the son of Daniel and Ann Ruddy back in 
Ireland, it also provided the names of the parents of the Michael Ruddy who 
married Catherine back in Ireland. It was a beautiful gesture of Michael 
Joseph's daughters, and, for the various family genealogists struggling to 
determine Irish origins of these Ruddy's, it provided a much-needed proof of 
the connection between the two brothers who farmed the family's 80 acres 
together in Fairview Township in Allamakee County, Iowa from 1865 to 1872: James 
M and Ellen (Murphy) Ruddy and Michael and Catherine (Gibbons) Ruddy. Beginning 
in 1872 these families began to move away from Iowa insuring that any 
reconstruction of Ruddy family history would be a challenge for their 
descendants. </b></font></p>
