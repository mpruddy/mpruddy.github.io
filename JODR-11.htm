		<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><font size="4">&nbsp;</font></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><font size="4">In 
		October, 1884, I went on board a steamer In Cork that was setting out 
		for Liverpool. She was put at sea five or six hours; her machinery broke 
		down and she put back to port for repairs, next day she set out on her 
		journey and again broke down anld put back to Cork. I did not go on her 
		a third time. T took the train for Dublin, and from Dublin I went to 
		Liverpool. I spent a month in England and Scotland, visiting the men of 
		the organization in the different towns and cities. A week tithe month 
		Ives spent in London and ha suburbs. Incidents of that month's travel 
		and association remain bright in my memory, but as I have to finish up 
		my story with this letter I must leave thorn unrecorded; two of them, 
		however, I will notice.</font></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><font size="4">I got 
		into the town of Blackburn at about eleven or twelve o'clock one night. 
		The St. Patrick's Brotherhood met at the Golden Star Hotel, and for that 
		hotel I faced. When I got to it I found none of the Members of the 
		society had been there, and there was no room disengaged in which I 
		could live during the night; there was no other hotel convenient, and no 
		car or carriage could ho engaged anywhere around. There was an Irishman 
		living convenient in whose house perhaps I could get lodging. His name 
		was Peter Kelly, and being directed to the house I went and knocked at 
		the door. The woman of the house opened the door, and to my inquiry for 
		lodgings said she did not keep a lodging house, but her husband often 
		brought home a belated traveler, who could not find shelter anywhere 
		else; but she had no place fit to receive me. &quot;No matter, Mrs. Kelly,&quot; 
		said I, &quot;we'll stay with you during the night; better have the shelter 
		you can give than no shelter at all.&quot; I satisfied her that the lady with 
		me was my wedded wife; that I know some Irishmen who had their meetings 
		over the way, and that I knew some of her old neighbors in Ireland 
		around where she was born. Next morning Mrs. Kelly had a nice little 
		breakfast for us of tea and coffee and toast and eggs, and had it 
		brought into the little bedroom. When we were about to take our 
		departure I asked her what her bill was. She said ten pence. I gave her 
		a two shilling piece; she gave me backs fourteen pence and I gave it to 
		the little children.</font></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><font size="4">Another 
		incident in the honeymoon life of an Irish traveling conspirator is 
		this: John Nolan is now in Now York; he is one of the head men of one of 
		the societies of the Ancient Order of Hibernians. He lived in Manchester 
		One time I was going through England. I united at his house and he told 
		me if I was traveling by Darlington to stop there and call to see a 
		friend of his who had influence among the Irishmen of the place. The 
		train stopped at Darlington one evening, about seven o'clock; trains 
		passed every hour that way toward Edinburgh; we came off our train. My 
		wife sat in the waiting room while I went to find John Nolan's friend; I 
		thought I'd be back in half an hour. I was not able to be back before 
		eleven or twelve o'clock. Mr. Nolan's friend used about a mile from the 
		railway station, and when I arrived at his house he had other friends 
		with him. I knew they all belonged to the same society and I explained 
		my mission to them, and they very plainly told mo they should look upon 
		me as a spy on bad purposes intent. They asked mo to say may prayers, to 
		say &quot;Our Father,&quot; and then &quot;Hail Mary&quot; and the Apostles' Creed. I said 
		to them; I had them by heart, because when I was young I was, as sinners 
		go, a pretty good Catholic and learned my prayers. But I could make no 
		hand of the men 1 met that night. One of them said he would do the right 
		thing if he went out and brought In a policemen and gave me up to him, 
		and I told him that doing that would be doing the very wrong thing. 
		entirely, and a thing that would brand him and the society he belonged 
		to with everlasting infamy. They threatened me, but I spoke stiff to 
		them; they vexed me. When I was bidding them goodby the man of the 
		house, shaking hands with me, left a half crownpiece in my hand. I gave 
		it back to him again, telling him I had as much money as would pay my 
		way to the end of my journey. He said it was possible I was a true man, 
		and if I was he would like to help to pay my way to the next town.</font></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><font size="4">
		Edinburgh—about the handsomest burgh in England, Ireland and 
		Scotland—was my next stopping place, and from Edinburgh I went to 
		Glasgow, where I spent two or three days with the two principal 
		organizers of that city—Edward McCloskey, now of 570 Fulton Ayenue, 
		Brooklyn, and Michael McLoughlin, of San Francisco.</font></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><font size="4">From 
		Glasgow Mike and I went to Dumbarton one day, and from Dumbarton to 
		Greenock; we had to travel in a fourth class train; it had no seats, and 
		the passengers had to stand up during the journey. I ended my month s 
		trip by crossing over to Belfast and going straight from Belfast to 
		Dublin.</font></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><font size="4">In the 
		spring of 1865 some of the military Irishmen of America came to Ireland. 
		One of the first who came was a cavalry officer, Captain George 
		Spearman, now of New York. I remember hint coming to my house in Camden 
		street, one morning, with a letter of introduction from John O’Mahony. 
		General F. F. Millen next came, and then Colonel Thomas Kelly, at 
		present in the Custom House, New York. This is the Colonel Kelly who 
		accompanied James Stephens to Scotland after Stephens' escape from 
		prison; the same Colonel Kelly who was subsequently arrested in 
		Manchester and rescued from the police.</font></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><font size="4">1865 was 
		to be the year of fight, as promised by Mr. Stephens, and all through 
		the mouths of that year the American officers kept coming in. As they 
		came they were detailed to different parts of the country. Colonel 
		Michael Kirwan (Now of the <i>New York</i> <i>Tablet</i>) came early in 
		summer, General Denis F. Burke came in September, the month the English 
		made the seizure of them and of all the &quot;suspects&quot; they could catch. 
		General Millen and Colonel Kelly came over more as commissioners to 
		examine into the state of the organization and report themselves back in 
		New York with the information than as officers to remain in Ireland to 
		take part in the fight, but when they saw the spirit of &quot;the men at 
		home&quot; they threw in their lot with those men, though they well knew they 
		were not in command of the necessary military means to fight. A council 
		meeting was called at Ashford in the County of Wicklow; we got there 
		about noon; dinner was ordered at the hotel for four o'clock for a party 
		of seven or eight, and then the seven or eight met at an appointed place 
		in the Devil's Glen, the entrance gate to which is quite convenient to 
		the hotel. On the side of the hill, in view of the waterfalls, this 
		council meeting was hold. James Stephens, John 0 Leary, Charles J. 
		Kickharn, and General Millen were present. Another council meeting was 
		held afterward in the month of July, on the mountainside back of the 
		Wooden Bridge Hotel in Wicklow. Colonel Tom Kelly, Thomas Clarke Luby, 
		David Bell, and General William G. Halpin, now of Cincinnati, were at 
		one of the meetings I speak of. I cannot remember if they were at both. 
		It was at the second meeting on the Wooden Bridge Mountain that the 
		resolution was passed approving of the issuing of bonds of the Irish 
		Republic, redeemable six months after the establishment of that 
		republic.</font></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><font size="4">Up to 
		this Mr. Stephens had no council, but John O'Mahony in America, had boon 
		asking that a council be organized in Ireland such as in America, as if 
		anything happened to Mr. Stephens there was no security that the work in 
		Ireland would not fall asunder, and the aid given from America to the 
		work of organization in Ireland would be gone for nothing. Mr. Stephens 
		acceded to this request made to him from America to form a council, and 
		the men on that council were Messrs. O'Leary, Kickham, Luby, Bell, 
		Millen and O'Donovan. In June Mr. Stephens told me he wanted to send 
		dispatches to America and he thought I would be the best man to go with 
		them if I could go; I offered to go, and he told me be ready to take the 
		steamer from the Cove of Cork the following Sunday. That Sunday I was in 
		Cork, and going from Cork down to Cove who should I see as engine driver 
		on the train but Dick Barry, who is now Commissioner of Streets in 
		Hoboken, N. J. &quot;Dick,&quot; said I, when the train reached Cove, &quot;there is a 
		trunk of mine among the baggage. I want it put on board the steamer, but 
		I don't want to be near it for fear of accident.&quot; &quot;I understand,&quot; said 
		Dick, &quot;I'll make it my business to see that trunk is put aboard the 
		steamer.&quot; I pointed out the trunk to him. It contained dispatches from 
		James Stephens, from General Millen and from Colonel Kelly to John 
		O'Mahony. I was known to the detectives and might be arrested, but I did 
		not want the trunk to be arrested. And the detectives were on my track 
		that day, because when I was on my trial in Dublin one of then came 
		forward to swear he saw me buy my ticket in Queenstown, and saw me go 
		aboard the ship and saw me landing in Queenstown from another ship a 
		month afterward. The ship I went out in was the Cuba, of the Cunard 
		line. My ticket was a second cabin one. I suppose there would be no 
		necessity to tell what sort of a ticket I had only that I am going to 
		tell a story in connection with the class of it which is an incident of 
		my life in connection with the progress of the Fenian movement.</font></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><font size="4">Thomas 
		D'Arcy McGee was a passenger on board the ship; so was Mr. McDonnell, 
		who was one time Premier of Canada. That time they were over to the 
		Dublin Exhibition as commissioners from the Dominion Government. D'Arcy 
		McGee had been down in Wexford and had been entertained at a banquet 
		there at which he made some speeches extolling England to the skies and 
		proclaiming himself to have been a big fool in his early days when ho 
		took it into his head in Ireland to be rebelliously disposed toward 
		England. I was in Wexford the week after he made the speech, and talking 
		to the men there I expressed surprise there was no shindy at that 
		banquet. They said they thought it better</font></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><font size="4">to remain 
		quiet and not bring the notice of the authorities upon them too much. 
		But here was I now on board the same ship with this Thomas D'Arcy McGee, 
		who wrote:</font></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" align="center" style="text-align:center">
		<font size="4">Ireland of the holy islands,</font></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" align="center" style="text-align:center">
		<font size="4">Circled round with mystic highlands,</font></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" align="center" style="text-align:center">
		<font size="4">Highlands of the valleys verdant,</font></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" align="center" style="text-align:center">
		<font size="4">Valleys of the torrent argent,</font></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" align="center" style="text-align:center">
		<font size="4">If I ever cease to love thee,</font></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" align="center" style="text-align:center">
		<font size="4">If I over fail to serve thee,</font></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" align="center" style="text-align:center">
		<font size="4">May I fall, and foulness cover</font></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" align="center" style="text-align:center">
		<font size="4">All my hopes and homestead over,</font></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" align="center" style="text-align:center">
		<font size="4">Die a dog’s death—outcast, hurried</font></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" align="center" style="text-align:center">
		<font size="4">Into earth as doge are buried.</font></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><font size="4">And sad 
		it is that D'Arcy McGee did desert that isle, and did die the death he 
		prayed for. But here was I now on board the one ship with him.</font></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><font size="4">The Cuba 
		put into Halifax and remained there four or five hours unloading iron 
		rails. I strolled up the mountain side, and as I was approaching the 
		fortifications to have a look at them an armed sentinel warned me away. 
		I came back into the town. I saw the name Donovan on the sign board of a 
		store: went in and asked the man of the house, &quot;What sort of a Donovan 
		are you?&quot; He looked puzzled at my question. &quot;You need not be surprised,&quot; 
		said I, &quot;at my asking you the question; I have just came from Ireland in 
		this ship back of your store here I know all the Donovans of Ireland. 
		Some of them are black and some of them white; some of them are English 
		and some of them Irish; I am a white Irish Donovan, but all my people 
		were robbed and exterminated from Ireland by the English. You may be one 
		of my Donovans, and that is why I ask the question?&quot; He told me who he 
		was and where his family lived, and, when I showed him that I know 
		people belonging to him, he would not allow me leave the house till he 
		opened a bottle of champagne.</font></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><font size="4">Our ship 
		set sail from Halifax and next day was the Fourth of July. The Americans 
		had a Fourth of July celebration on board, and all the passengers in the 
		second class cabin were invited into the first class one. I didn't go 
		in, but, by and by, a New York man, named Sullivan, came looking for me; 
		he pressed me to go in and I gave him my reasons for not desiring to be 
		there. &quot;Come and be my guest,&quot; said he; &quot;sit at my table; I will pay out 
		of my own pocket for what comes on that table and you'll partake of none 
		of their banquet.&quot; I went with him, his table was about the middle of 
		the saloon. The captain of the ship was chairman, at his right sat 
		McDonald and at his left, McGee. The first toast on the list at this 
		Fourth of July celebration was “The Queen,” and Thomas D'Arcy McGee was 
		called upon to respond. He got up and commenced lauding the Queen and 
		the Queen's government. and speaking in that strain about five minutes. 
		I got up, walked toward the door, and as I was passing the chairman and 
		McGee, I said; &quot;If this is the way you celebrate the Fourth of July 
		you'll celebrate it without my company.&quot;</font></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><font size="4">Next day 
		I was up on deck reading a book, sitting where I used to sit every sunny 
		day since the ship left the Cove of Cork; the purser came up to me, 
		saying: &quot;You'll have to leave this and take your proper place in tile 
		ship; this is for first class passengers only, and you're a second class 
		passenger.&quot; &quot;I sat in this place every day since the ship left Ireland, 
		why can't I sit there now?&quot; &quot;You can't sit there any more; you'll have 
		to go back of that funnel there; you know what you did last night&quot; Back 
		I went. I suppose it was foolish for me to act as I did at the Fourth of 
		July celebration, but I cannot help doing foolish things sometimes.</font></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><font size="4">The Cuba 
		having arrived in Boston I sought out the depot for New York. I arrived 
		there two or three hours before a train would start, and during those 
		two or three hours I met a number of men whom I know in Ireland. The 
		depot was full of soldiers coming home from the war, (July, 1865,) 
		—you'd think it was an Irish war they were in, and there they were, 
		comrades in fight, bidding good by to each other as every local train 
		took some of them away.</font></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><font size="4">Next day 
		I delivered my dispatches to John O'Mahony in New York, and a few days 
		after a council meeting was hold at the house of Colonel William R. 
		Roberts, in Bloomingdale. I think at that meeting were Doody, of 
		Massachusetts, Bannon, of Kentucky, Gibbons, of Philadelphia, John 
		O'Mahony, Colonel Roberts, P. J. Meehan, P. W. Dunne, Michael Scanlan 
		and Patrick O'Rourke. The dispatches were read, I answered all questions 
		put to me, everything was satisfactory and supplies were voted to the 
		Irish movement. Colonel Tom Kelly said in his dispatch that in the 
		regular line of his duty he should come back and report personally, but 
		so attached had he grown to the men he met in Ireland, so willing were 
		they to engage in fight with the enemy, though they were not properly 
		armed to fight, that he ventured to disobey his orders to come back, and 
		would remain over to share with them the fortunes of the fight. General 
		Millen's dispatch spoke a similar spirit.</font></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><font size="4">John 
		O'Mahony wanted me to stay in America: he said so many people came to 
		Fenian head quarters and asked him so many questions about the 
		organization in Ireland which he could not answer that he was often 
		puzzled, but with me in the office who could satisfactorily answer all 
		such questions everything would go on smoothly. I told him and the 
		council that I could not stay and that I would not stay, that if I 
		remained in America and a fight took place in Ireland all the water 
		between here and Ireland would not wash me from the stain of cowardice. 
		P. J. Meehan and P. W. Dunne had had preparations made to go to Ireland 
		before I reached America. O'Mahony said he would send by them a message 
		to James Stephens that would got him to send me back again as soon as I 
		got over. I said he could do what he liked that way. He did send a note 
		to Mr. Stephens asking him to send &quot;O'Donnell&quot; back immediately; it was 
		one of the papers Mr. Meehan lost, it was produced in evidence against 
		me at my trial, it was a nail in my coffin; the shipping clerk and the 
		detective in Queenstown were brought up to Dublin to swear that I took 
		my passage ticket in the Cuba in the name of O'Donnell.</font></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><font size="4">Much has 
		been said by Fenians in connection with Mr. Meehan and &quot;those lost 
		documents&quot; this is what I have said many a time and what I have to say 
		today on that subject:</font></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><font size="4">Going 
		into the Cove of Cork I told Mr. Meehan that as I left Ireland in a 
		troublous state, and not knowing but there may be a rigorous search on 
		landing, it would be well for him to give those papers he hail to his 
		sister or Mrs. Dunne, who accompanied us. He told me they were all 
		right, that he had sewed them up between the soles of one of his carpet 
		slippers. Next day he lost these papers in Kingstown, where he went to 
		deliver them to James Stephens. Pursuant to the caution given him and 
		his own promptings, he thought it better not to have those papers in any 
		pocket of his, and he fastened them with a pin, as ho told us, inside 
		the waist of his drawers. The pin slipped out and the letters slipped 
		away unknown to him. The charge has been made against him that he lost 
		these documents intentionally. All I say is that the matter was 
		discussed at a council meeting in Dublin, that I gave it as my opinion 
		he lost them honestly, and I have no evidence since to warrant me in 
		changing that opinion.</font></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><font size="4">Twenty 
		years have passed by since the occurrence. When the English authorities 
		in Ireland got possession of these papers that were lost by Mr. Meehan 
		they got possession of evidence of the conspiracy—evidence on which they 
		could go before a jury and ask for a conviction of the conspirators. Bet 
		let me not be mistaken on this head: England can get a jury to convict 
		Irishmen any time she likes, and if the documents Mr. Meehan lost were 
		never in existence we would be convicted all the same. When England 
		considers it expedient to imprison men in Ireland, the expediency is 
		sufficient warrant for their arrest and imprisonment That was 
		demonstrated within the past four or five years.</font></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><font size="4">In 
		September 65 I was under orders from James Stephens to be off to America 
		again. I was to sail from the Cove of Cork on Sunday the 16th. On Friday 
		evening my wife was packing my trunk, preparing for my start next 
		morning, but a more sudden start than that came, for on that same Friday 
		evening about 8 o'clock the police broke into the Irish People newspaper 
		building in Parliament street and took full possession of everything 
		that was in the house. They carted off to Dublin castle the type, the 
		furniture, the books, the papers and everything else that was portable. 
		A half au hour before the arrests I was at Carey's Hotel, in Bridge 
		street, in company with Corydon, who afterward in the capacity of 
		informer appeared on the witness table swearing against the Fenian 
		prisoners. At the moment of the seizure of the Irish People office I was 
		at the corner of Dame street, a little below Parliament street, a block 
		or so away from the office. Patrick Kearney ran up to me, whispering 
		&quot;Rossa, the office is seized; the door is broken in, the police are all 
		around keeping guard: can't we fight? &quot;There are no orders for fight, 
		Paddy,&quot; said I —&quot;but I’ll go up to the office and see what it's all 
		about.&quot; The words were not out of my mouth when four or five detectives 
		laid hold of me and hurried me through the Lower Castle Yard into a 
		police station. I was about the first man in, but I was not long without 
		company. Captain James Murphy, now in charge of the National Cemetery in 
		Beverly, New Jersey, was ushered in after me; then Came Mr. Luby, the 
		registered proprietor of the paper, Mr. O'Leary, the editor, and nearly 
		all the employees —printers as well as others. Many men not connected 
		with our office wore also brought in. Captain James Murphy wanted to 
		know why he was arrested — he, a &quot;citizen of Boston, with no charge made 
		against him, or no warrant of arrest.&quot; I kept poking fun at him about 
		his Boston citizenship: he was under British jurisdiction now, and he'd 
		see the beauties of it, and see how little England regarded his American 
		citizenship. Captain Murphy was released from prison after ten days, 
		then James Stephens sent him with dispatches to the Philadelphia 
		convention; he returned to Ireland again, was imprisoned again for about 
		ten months, was then released, and before he left England had some 
		satisfaction out of his enemy in the blowing up of Clerkenwell prison in 
		London. It was he conducted that work.</font></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><font size="4">About 
		fifty men were arrested in Dublin the night Captain Murphy was arrested; 
		arrests were made the same night in other towns and cities throughout 
		the land. There was no law, but what was contained in England's will and 
		wish; but, to make this arrest and imprisonment of the people legal, the 
		London parliament voted the suspension of the habeas corpus act in 
		Ireland. &quot;Habeas corpus&quot; substantially says, &quot;You may have possession of 
		your own body,&quot; but when you are not doing what England likes with your 
		body, then England turns to and takes possession of it and manages it 
		for you. Some days after our arrest we were brought from Richmond prison 
		to the Castle Yard and put through the form of a mock preliminary trial. 
		We were indicted for treason felony and sent to jail—without bail—till 
		the ensuing assizes in December. A week after the preliminary trial, the 
		stipendiary magistrate, the governor of the jail and one of the Attorney 
		General's assistants came to us in Richmond prison, and read some papers 
		for us to the effect that the charge of treason felony was withdrawn, 
		and for it was substituted the charge of high treason. That was a 
		hanging matter, and I actually hanged myself in imagination that day, 
		preparing myself for the worst. I felt bad at being hanged, but I made 
		up my mind I would die game and tight and defy them to the bitter end.</font></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><font size="4">Counsel 
		was employed for our defense, but I made up my mind I would have no 
		counsel; I would defend myself. Their trial by English law of an Irish 
		political offender In Ireland is a farce, and I said to myself I would 
		take a part in playing the farce with them. I did it too; I kept playing 
		with Judge and jury, provoking thorn for five days.</font></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><font size="4">James 
		Stephens was not arrested the night of the general arrests in September; 
		he escaped arrest until the 22rd of November, and then escaped from jail 
		two weeks after. I may as well state how this escape was effected; I 
		have heard many ignorant men say James Stephens was taken out of jail 
		with the connivance of the English Government; they say what I know to 
		be a lie; the manner and means of his escape were these:</font></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><font size="4">A center 
		of a circle of the organization stands in the position of a colonel of a 
		regiment; he has his nine captains, each of whom has nine sergeants, 
		each of which sergeants has his nine privates; the whole circle numbers 
		820 men with its center or colonel. John Kirwan, who is now in New York, 
		employed as collector for one of the gas companies, was center of a 
		circle in Dublin; he had been a captain in the Pope's Brigade In Italy, 
		and it happened that five of the men of his circle were employed in 
		Richmond Prison, in which James Stephens and myself and Others were 
		confined.</font></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><font size="4">When 
		Stephens had been put in prison Captain Tom Kelly had been organizing a 
		signal service corps, of which Edmond O'Donovan, who was killed in the 
		Soudan last year, was one of the engineers. Some of Captain Kirwan's men 
		were in that corps. Captain Kirwan communicated with Captain Kelly and 
		informed him he could get Stephens taken out of prison, and on that 
		communication action was taken. To be accurate on this matter I went to 
		the residence of Captain Kelly a short time ago, and had a long talk 
		with him. &quot;Rossa,&quot; said he, &quot;I have seen credit given to this man and 
		that man for the taking of James Stephens out of prison, hut the man to 
		whom credit is due has been never spoken of in connection tvith the 
		affair; that man is Captain John Kirwan, of the Pope's Brigade; it was 
		he first told me the thing could be done, and it was on his plans action 
		was taken. I then wrote to Captain Kirwan who lives in Tompkins street, 
		New York, and received this letter from him:</font></p>

margin-left:.5in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-align:justify"><font size="4">MY 
		DEAR Friend—In reply to your letter asking for information about the 
		Stephens escape and other matters in '67, I desire to have it well 
		understood that the first suggestion for such escape came from me. I 
		reported as a Dublin center to Mr. S. in 16 Great Brunswick street that 
		I had sworn in a Mr. O’Byrne and had given him the metal permission to 
		spread the organization. O'Byrne was then a warden in Richmond 
		Bridewell; he had been a corporal in my company of the Pope’s Brigade. I 
		gave him the form of oath with orders to destroy it when committed to 
		memory; unfortunately he failed to do so and this was the document found 
		in O'Byrne's trunk when arrested. The police attempted to arrest me on 
		Monday, time 18th of September, '65, on the Grand Canal, near James 
		Street. I resisted arrest. I left Smith, Giles and King, the detectives, 
		sprawling on the ground, leaped into the canal and swam across it then 
		went to Shannon Harbor, Limerick, Athlone and other places. I returned 
		to Dublin in October and was staying in the house of a Mrs. Duffy, in 
		New Bride Street. John Ryan, of Liverpool was there at the same time. My 
		name was on the hue and cry. Stephens was arrested soon after and went 
		to jail without a fight, although he had a strong house, easily 
		defended, well provisioned and armed, and had stout comrades to aid him.</font></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top:0in;margin-right:.5in;margin-bottom:0in;
margin-left:.5in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-align:justify"><font size="4">I had 
		then seven sworn warders in the prison in which Stephens was confined, 
		and I said I could let Stephens out. I asked Ryan to go and bring Tom 
		Kelly to me; he came to Mrs. Duffs and we discussed the matter. I then 
		agreed to send for O’Byrne and order him to act with Captain Kelly, as I 
		could not travel the city myself. I sent my wife to the prison for 
		O'Byrne, he came to me next evening, and I introduced him and Kelly to 
		each other. We then proceeded to a house at the corner of Pleasant and 
		Heytesbury Streets, where we met several American officers—among them 
		General Denis F. Burke and Colonel Michael Kirwan.</font></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top:0in;margin-right:.5in;margin-bottom:0in;
margin-left:.5in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-align:justify"><font size="4">The 
		business was discussed, some one said the English offered £200 for the 
		arrest of James Stephens, but he offered O’Byrne £100 if he would let 
		him go. O'Byrne scoffed the offer as an insult, said he was a soldier of 
		Ireland, and pointed to me as his officer he would do as I bade him. 
		&quot;They can only hang me,” he said &quot;but I will face death for Ireland.&quot; I 
		make the claim that to myself, to O’Byrne and to John Breslin, who, 
		though not a member of the organization, rendered material help from 
		first to last belongs the work of taking James Stephens out of England's 
		hands.</font></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top:0in;margin-right:.5in;margin-bottom:0in;
margin-left:.5in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-align:justify"><font size="4">I 
		attended several meetings to complete details, but it was decided it 
		would be better I should not be present at the final act, because of my 
		person being well known to the police, and if overhauled would fight, 
		and perhaps ruin the whole affair There were twelve men posted around 
		the prison walls as coverers, but they had no more to do with Stephens' 
		escape than the man in the moon, although they say they helped; but 
		their services were not needed.</font></p>

		Sincerely yours, John Kirwan. </font></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><font size="4">The day 
		proceeding the night that James Stephens was taken out of prison John 
		Breslin came into my cell and told me Stephens was to be taken away that 
		night. I tried to keep awake all night, but I didn't keep awake. I fell 
		asleep and was roused up in the morning early by the slamming of doors 
		and the usual noise made in a prison when it is known that a prisoner 
		has escaped. The escape was effected by 'having impressions on wax taken 
		of the keys of the doors that locked in the prisoner; one of our 
		mechanics in the city made new keys from those impressions, the new keys 
		were tried on the doors, and were found to be perfect. O'Byrne and 
		Breslin inside the prison did the work of bringing Stephens from his 
		cell to the prison wall the confederates outside the wall had a rope 
		thrown in, but the end of it did not reach the men inside. Two tables 
		were brought from one of the prison rooms, one was put on top of the 
		other, and from the top one Stephens reached the rope and was thus got 
		over the wall. The tables were left on the ground.</font></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><font size="4">James 
		Stephens was taken to a friend's house and remained there for some time. 
		£2,000 reward was offered for his arrest, but no one took the bribe, 
		though many knew where he was. It was arranged that he was to leave the 
		country in a schooner that was to wait for him in the Harbor of 
		Skerries, but when he and his escort were at Skerries they found that an 
		English gunboat was cruising around the place; they put back to Dublin 
		again, and from Dublin they set sail, and made land at Ardrossan, in 
		Scotland; from Ardrossan they made their way to London, by rail from 
		London to Dover, and from Dover to France. The escort were Captain Tom 
		Kelly and John —somebody; I will not tell his name as he is still in 
		British waters. I had the honor of a slight acquaintanceship with him, 
		and from the character Captain Kelly gives of him in connection with the 
		rescue of James Stephens, a cooler or a braver Irishman is not on Irish 
		ground. At the French pier in Dover there are flights of stairs 
		descending from the quay to the steamer: as the passengers were going 
		toward the ship and passing the scrutiny of the detectives and police 
		who were on the watch. It was arranged that John would stop and knock 
		against the police in some accidental manner, and while he was 
		apologizing to them Kelly and Stephens were to slip into the ship. The 
		plan succeeded according to that arrangement, and they got to France 
		safely.</font></p>

		<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><font size="4">Many 
		things contributed to the temporary failure or collapse of the Fenian 
		rnovement; I will just glance them by and let the reader gather his own 
		conclusions from them. Justin McCarthy, Member of Parliament, is now 
		writing in the Dublin Freeman about the men of '48 and the cause of the 
		failure of that movement, and I find a passage in the last letter he has 
		written that exactly answers my case. He Says:</font></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top:0in;margin-right:.5in;margin-bottom:0in;
margin-left:.5in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-align:justify"><font size="4">The 
		Young Irelanders were not ready for rebellion when their plans wore made 
		known to the Government; and the Government struck at them before they 
		could do anything. Mitchel was arrested, tried and transported to 
		Bermuda. That was the tuning point of the Revolution. The Mitchelites 
		wished to rise in rescue. They urged and rightly urged, that if 
		revolution was meant at all then was the time. But the less extreme men 
		held back. An autumnal rising had been decided upon, and they were 
		unwilling to anticipate the struggle. They carried their point. Mitchel 
		was sentenced to fourteen years' transportation. When the verdict was 
		delivered he declared that, like the Roman Scaevola, he could promise 
		hundreds who would follow his example, and as he spoke he pointed to 
		Meagher, John Martin and others of the association who were thronging 
		the galleries of the court. A wild cry came up from all his friends, 
		&quot;Promise for me, Mitchel—promise for me!&quot; With that cry ringing in his 
		ears he was hurried from the court, heavily chained and encircled by a 
		little array of dragoons, to the war sloop Shearwater that had been 
		waiting for the verdict and the man. As the war ship steamed out of 
		Dublin harbor the hopes of the Young Irelanders went with her, vain and 
		evanescent, from that hour forth as the smoke that floated in the 
		steamer s wake. There is a pathetic little story which records Mitchel's 
		looking out of the prison van that drove him from the court, and seeing 
		a great crowd, and asking where they were going, and being told that 
		they were going to a flower show. There wore plenty of men in the 
		movement who would have gladly risked everything to try and rescue 
		Mitchel. But nothing could have been done without unanimity, and the
		</font><i><font size="4">too great caution of the leaders prevented the 
		effort at the moment when it could have had the faintest hope of 
		success.</font></i></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><font size="4">You see 
		that expression there which I have italicized, &quot;the too great caution of 
		the leaders prevented the effort at the moment when it could have had 
		the faintest hope of success.&quot; 1865, the time promised, was the time to 
		make the fight and the night of the arrests as good a night as any. I am 
		not saying there was any certainty of having a successful fight or a 
		successful revolution that time, but it was the time when it could have 
		some hope of success; soldiers were still in the country who would give 
		up the barracks and forts to the men of the organization and would then 
		fight side by side with them; the men of the organization were ready and 
		willing to they orders to fight even though they had not suitable arms 
		and ammunition. A dashing, daring commander who would take chances and 
		take odds against the enemy at that time could do something great with 
		the thousands of men who were ready to face death for Ireland's freedom. 
		James Stephens was the leader; the responsibility no doubt was great; he 
		probably felt it, but had he given the orders to fight and had the fight 
		failed, his reputation and Ireland's reputation would have been no worse 
		than they are to-day. Twenty thousand of the men who would fight that 
		day are this day lying in their graves without striking a blow.</font></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><font size="4">There 
		were &quot;risings&quot; of the people in 1866 and 1867. Captain John Kirwan, 
		already spoken of, was in a rising in Dublin. The party took some police 
		barracks and made prisoners of some police, Captain Kirwan having been 
		wounded in the attack. Captain John McClure, now in New York, was at the 
		fight in Kilclooney Wood, where Peter O'Neill Crowley was killed, and 
		was sentenced to be hanged for it, but his sentence was commuted to 
		penal servitude for life. He worked at penal servitude in Chatham Prison 
		with me. John Kearney, now in New York, with his Millstreet men, and 
		Captain Timothy Deasy, of Lawrence, one of the men rescued in 
		Manchester, made a raid upon the Castle of Mount Leader, near Kanturk, 
		and took what arms were in it. Colonel O'Connor led a rising in Kerry, 
		but there was no general uprising of the people. The people depended too 
		much upon &quot;foreign aid,&quot; the aid from America. The arms promised them 
		from America had not come and the hopes they had cherished were 
		withered.</font></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><font size="4">When 
		James Stephens was arrested and put to prison the centers of Dublin held 
		a meeting, and they chose General F. F. Millen as provisional chief of 
		the organization during Mr. Stephens’ incarceration. General Millen set 
		to work to prepare for fight, but when Mr. Stephens heard this news in 
		prison he sent out word that he could conduct the organization from 
		prison, and he sent General Millen to America Then Mr. Stephens escaped 
		from prison, escaped from Ireland, and never went back there since. 
		Colonel Tom Kelly acted for a time as chief of the organization. and 
		Edward Duffy acted for a time as chief, but England this time was acting 
		her own part; she was putting in prison all the American officers she 
		could catch, and all the spirited Irishmen she suspected of treasonable 
		designs and seditious doings, and she obliged the people who were not 
		imprisoned to turn their attention to the providing of funds for the 
		defense of the prisoners and for the support of their families. She 
		played another favorite game of hers. She had her police and detectives 
		and the wives of her police and detectives going around to the wives and 
		mothers of disaffected Irishmen, giving them private friendly hints or 
		&quot;tips' that informations were sworn against the men, and that their 
		arrest was only a matter of a day or two's delay the men would then go 
		&quot;on the run&quot; to England, to America or Australia, and thus England was 
		rid of them without any more trouble —all England wanted, and all she 
		wants all times—to root the Irish out of Ireland. This trick of 
		frightening them away was very generally played during the late Land 
		League imprisonments in Ireland. Many of the men arrested were released 
		on condition of leaving the country, and were escorted from prison to 
		the emigrant ship: how much pleasanter it is for England when she can 
		get rid of her unruly subjects without being put to the ugly trouble of 
		filling her jails with them first. The men who are frightened out of 
		Ireland by English fairy stories such as I have alluded to are not the 
		men to win Ireland's freedom. One thing James Stephens did in ‘64, and 
		‘65, he made it be understood that any man who left Ireland those years 
		without permission would be looted upon as a deserter—as a coward who 
		would be running away from the fight, and in consequence of that very 
		few men of the organization left Ireland those years, but when Stephens 
		himself left Ireland there was general demoralization and a general 
		skedaddle. However, the men who were sent to carry on the work of 
		revolution did not remain idle. A plan was formed to make a raid on 
		Chester Castle and capture the arms that were in nation capture the 
		Chester train and Holyhead steamer. Men flocked toward Chester from 
		different towns in England, but when they got to the appointed place 
		they found it strongly garrisoned, and many of them were arrested and 
		put to prison. Corydon had been in the plot, and had turned informer; he 
		had &quot;sold the pass.&quot; Captain James Murphy, who blew up Clerkenwell, is 
		in the room with me as I am writing these lines; I am after asking him, 
		&quot;Was Corydon bad from the commencement?&quot; His answer, &quot;No, because if he 
		was bad from the commencement, he would have prevented the escape of 
		Stephens from Richmond prison, he had a knowledge of that plan, too. 
		Massy was another of the American soldiers who turned informer; it seems 
		he was not bad at first either, but he weakened when he saw himself 
		hemmed in by the English enemy.</font></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><font size="4">&quot;James, 
		what would you say was the principal cause of the collapse of the 
		movement that time?&quot; That is a question I have asked of Captain Murphy 
		just now, and his reply is one that thoroughly accords with my own 
		opinion on the subject. It is this:</font></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><font size="4">&quot;The 
		principal cause of the collapse that time was that the organization in 
		America split; it had promised its whole aid to the men in Ireland to 
		fight in Ireland; now half of it turned its assistance away from Ireland 
		and directed it to the fighting of England in Canada. That diversion of 
		half the organization in the wrong direction at the time paralyzed the 
		efforts of the other half in the right direction; the men in Ireland 
		could get little help from America, despondency set in and England 
		worked her will upon the dispirited and disarmed people in Ireland.&quot;</font></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><font size="4">For the 
		present I will conclude this sketch of the Fenian movement here. At 
		another time I may gather the old O'Mahony Fenian correspondence I have 
		at Fenian headquarters, and publish some letters from organizers and 
		centers and secretaries of Fenian circles, who swore eternal fidelity to 
		the Fenian cause and the Fenian principles, but who very soon turned 
		tail to their pledges and their oaths, and ran after the will o the wisp 
		of agitation that promised popularity, and promised Ireland's freedom 
		without the trouble or pain of shedding a drop of blood for it. Those 
		Irish patriotic soupers in America are as much to be blamed as anything 
		else for the temporary failure of Fenianism.</font></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><font size="4">I am done 
		for the present; the BROOKLYN EAGLE does not agree with me in many 
		things I have said, in many opinions I have expressed; and I now thank 
		its editor, and compliment him for being BO free minded and independent 
		as to have allowed me to express myself as I feel and as I think upon 
		the Fenian movement.</font></p>
