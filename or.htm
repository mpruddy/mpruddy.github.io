<p><strong>At the end of the Civil War, Congress appropriated
money to collect all of the correspondance which transpired
during the war between the various officers and officials. It
includes correspondance of both sides, US and CSA. The final
result is 127 volumes of around 700-1000pp each and a General
Index. The OR is a primary source for battle information and not
a major Genealogical record. If you want to find out what your
ancestor's unit was doing during the war, the OR can be a
godsend. Of the millions who served only a few are listed and
except in some rare(compared to the number of PVTs who served)
instances, most are officers. That does not mean you shouldn't
look in the OR; but, there is a good chance, same as when
purchasing a Census CD Rom that the person you are looking for
isn't in there. I would NOT buy it to find my relative. There are
1000+ pages at 100 entries a page in the general index, many of
which are locations and not people. Let's say 50% of the entries
are surnames that is only 50,000 names out of, maybe 4,000,000
participants. Having stated those caveats, if you have the
option, go to the library and check the OR for there are many
cases of an enlisted man being mentioned as gallant in battle or
they might be mentioned if they were in involved in some action
or event described by an officer.<br>
<br>
The OR is a primary source for writers, students and anyone who
wants to get the flavor of being there, for, although not all
that was written is fact, all that is there was written at the
time by those who participated. There is a paucity of Confederate
correspondance due to records lost, hidden, or destroyed at the
end of the war, but still there is considerable CSA
correspondance all things considered. There is an indescribable
feeling one gets reading the reports of officers explaining their
battle strategy or calling for re-enforcements.. or covering
their posteriors after a debacle. Many libraries have these
volumes (they can also be purchased on CD ROM) and the companion
30 or so volumes of Naval correspondance(the Naval OR is not on
CD ROM yet) They can also be purchased in republished editions or
found in the original in out-of-print bookstores for about
$30-$40 per volume. They can certainly help you trace your
ancestor's regiment movements provided you know the regiment. The
OR has a general index and each volume has an index to the
volume. </strong><br>
