<p ALIGN="CENTER">PREFACE.</p>
</font>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In offering this volume to the public, a few words of
explanation are deemed necessary, not so much for its appearance, as for the
arrangement of its contents.</p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As to its appearance, the state of Irish affairs calls for
some record, and as, owing to peculiar circumstances, the nearest approach to a
perfect chronicle which can now be offered, is an account of those who brought
about the crisis and are gallantly struggling through it, the present form was
adopted.</p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The arrangement is not entirely what might be desired by a
strict chronologist; but as the <i>data </i>had to be obtained from widely
scattered references and correspondents-the friends or families of those
commemorated-and as the pages went to the press when written, it was found
impossible to follow perfect chronological order. As a general rule, the
characters are grouped as they acted together, and thus help to illustrate each
others lives; and a slight hint will enable the reader to follow the history of
the Irish struggle in a direct course, and to fill up, so to speak, the outline
given in the Historical Introduction.</p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Thus (1) in addition to what is said there of the effort in
'48, the sketches of Doheny, Meany, O'Mahony, and Stephens, further illustrate
the doings of that period. (2) Mr. Luby's notice of Philip Gray gives the
efforts which imme-</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">diately followed the scattering of &quot;Young Ireland.&quot;
(3) The sketch of J. O'Donovan (Rossa) presents the rise of the &quot;Phoenix
Society;&quot; while the progress of the Fenian Brotherhood, and the more recent
events -- risings, arrests, escapes and trials-connected with it, are narrated
with intelligible fullness in the notices of the respective heroes and martyrs
of the most historical transactions.</p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">No effort has been spared to secure and present the most
authentic <i>data</i>. The files of the Dublin <i>Irishman</i>, <i>Nation</i>,
and <i>Cork Herald</i>, and those of the New York <i>Irish People</i>, <i>Irish-American</i>,
and <i>Boston Pilot</i>, have been found useful, especially when their reports
and statements were corroborated by competent witnesses, or indorsed by actors
in the scenes related. A quantity of interesting personal and political history
has been placed at the disposal of the writer by associates and relatives of
many of the heroes and martyrs, of which free use has been made to give <b>value
</b>to these pages. Among those to whom special thanks are due, are General John
O'Neill, for official documents ; Colonel O'Connor, Captains O'Rorke, Condon,
and Conyngham, and Messrs. T. B. Henessey, (of Boston,) Walter M. J. O'Dwyer, M.
J. Heffernan, Wm. J. McClure, M. Moynahan, D. O.'Sullivan, and M. Cavanagh, of
New York.</p>

  is a monumental era -- recording the achievement of the legislative

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">voted island. The sixteenth and seventeenth centuries are
deeply, horribly saturated in Irish blood. But the conflicts cannot reasonably
be accounted national, although they were at times characterized by patriotic
motives and elements. They were the natural results of the extermination of the
native Irish, and the planting of their inheritances by the adherents of James
the First and his successors -- those Stuarts, whose primal idea was to create
and sustain &quot;an English interest in Ireland.&quot; This was the touchstone
of the Stuart policy, which was to be furthered and fostered, at all hazards, by
every intrigue, and the sacrifice of every vow and tie, religious, legal and
political.</p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The wars which grew out of these land questions, together
with the risings and revolts of a more avowed patriotic character, became as
frequent, as complicated, as inveterate, as treacherous and bloody as a number
of rival parties, all hating each other, and each ready to join the English to
weaken the others, could make them. Thus the English Protestants and English
Catholics in Ireland alternately feared and hated the English ascendancy,
according as it was manifested by a Cromwell or a William of Orange in
opposition to the Catholics, or by a Charles the Second or a James the Second in
supposed opposition to the Protestants, but who were actually intriguing to</p>

were thus afraid and watchful of each other on religious grounds, as the
Government patronized or persecuted them respectively, they had, at the same
time, an identity of interest in hating, watching, and uniting against the
natives.</p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">On the other hand, the memory and result of confiscations and
pillage had overcome, if they had not totally swept away, all the tolerant
amenities which a common religion might be supposed to protect. - The Irish
Catholic hated the English Catholic as much as the English Protestant feared
both. The old Irish were jealous of, and would not coalesce with, the Irish of
English descent ; while distrust on every side created and excused unnatural
apathy, where it did not inspire ignoble treachery. But for these feuds and
follies Cromwell could <sup>-</sup>not have struck terror throughout the island,
sacrificing not only the Irish, but the Catholics of English extraction, who
were not less antagonistic to the older natives than himself.</p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As Cromwell beat the Stuarts in the field, so did he outshine
them in the magnitude of his confiscations. He signalized it by blood and tears
in the four provinces. He extended the Plantation of Ulster, divided Leinster
and Munster among his soldiers and money-lenders, and sent those he had not time
to massacre to <sup>&quot;</sup>Hell or Connaught.&quot;</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Oliver's<b> </b>death and the Restoration of the Monarchy and
the Stuarts, brought some uneasiness to the Puritan settlers. The Loyalists who
had lost their properties supporting the Stuart cause in 'Ireland, claimed the
restitution of their estates. This would have been just, but it would also have
interfered with the establishment of an &quot;English interest in Ireland,&quot;
by giving power and influence into the hands of Irish Chieftains. These land
claims were subjected to tedious routine, forms, equivocation, and finally an
Act of Settlement, which, passed by a Parliament from which Catholics were
excluded, naturally ignored all interests save those of Protestants.</p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Thus the unfortunate and beggared Catholic cavaliers who had
supported Charles the First, were denied recognition or restitution when his
dynasty was restored. The successful enemies of Charles beggared the Irish
Catholics for supporting him. The successful friends of Charles kept them in
beggary. A complication of circumstances still controlled the destinies of these
insulted people to the Stuart interest ; and they had the further ill-fate of
shedding more blood, and freely spilling their own for that ungrateful race in
the &quot;succeeding reign. Their wrongs and their errors forced them to join
with James the Second, because the Cromwellians (as the settlers under &quot;the
Protector&quot; and<b> </b>their<b> </b>descendants were called) and Protestants</p>

Ireland, already put in jeopardy by the repeal of the Act of Settlement, under
which they had revelled in<b> </b>the forfeited estates of the Irish victims of
the four previous reigns. The exigencies of the English planter and Cromwellian
land-owner gave hope to the ejected Irish Catholic, and he attached himself to
the fortunes, or rather, as it proved, misfortunes of James, not through any
great faith in him, or love for him; but simply because it was the only
opportunity of striking a blow at the English interest, as represented by the
adherents of William of Orange-that very English interest which it was the
subtle purpose of James himself to perpetuate. Through a consciousness of the
double part he was playing, James, while he threw himself on the faith of the
Irish, was so distrustful of them, coupled with the desire to conciliate some of
the Protestant leaders, that he disbanded several Irish regiments soon after his
arrival. He was a mean and irresolute leader, seeking to achieve by a
self-delusive vacillation, which he thought diplomacy, the power he should have
grasped by an assured victory. No better indication of his character is needed
than that given by Sarsfield on the retreat from the Boyne, when James's
distrust of his adherents breaking forth, the Irish officer exclaimed :
&quot;Exchange but kings, and we fight the battle over again.&quot;</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The precipice upon which the English interest in Ireland
stood during the Williamite war, and until the Treaty of Limerick, warned it
against being found in such a dangerous position in any future emergency. To
prevent the possibility of a recurrence, the Penal Laws were established -- a
code which, as a deep student and shrewd political philosopher of Irish birth,
who devoted his life and intellect to the glory of England, Edmund Burke, said,
&quot;was a machine of wise and elaborate contrivance, as well fitted for the
oppression, impoverishment and degradation of a people, and the debasement in
them of human nature itself, as ever proceeded from the perverted ingenuity of
man.&quot; This terrible legal extermination of the Irish emanated less from
intolerance than inhumanity, for the contrivers were too crafty to be fanatics,
and only heartless and remorseless enough to be despots, in the widest and
meanest acceptation of the term. Intended to send all Catholics to the grave,
the Penal Code took hold of them in the cradle.</p>
<p>The children of Catholics could not be educated in Ireland save by Protestant
teachers, and could not be sent out of Ireland without being guilty of a Penal
offence. Catholic children were to be educated in the English interest or not at
all; -- their brains were to be kindled by the light of Protestant wisdom, or
left in total darkness.<b></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Every profession, save that of medicine, was forbidden to the
Catholic. Even though educated by a Protestant, the Catholic student or scholar
could not seek the reward of cultivation in any save one of the liberal
professions-unless lie disclaimed his father's religion and claimed his father's
property.</p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In the trade and commerce of all corporate towns, Catholics
were held as pirates and outlaws; being legally excluded from joining or
participating therein. In these towns, a Catholic could not sell anything save
himself.</p>
<p>No Catholic could hold a long lease, or purchase land for a longer tenure
than thirty-one years.</p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">No Catholic could inherit the lands of a Protestant relative,
or own a horse of greater value than five pounds. If lie was possessed of a
valuable animal, any Protestant jockey or gentleman, or both in one, could fancy
it and take it by paying five pounds.</p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">A Catholic child, becoming a Protestant, could sue his
parents for maintenance, the amount to be decided by the Court of Chancery.</p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">An eldest son becoming a Protestant made his father a tenant
for life, reversion in fee being secured to the convert, with a proviso limiting
the portion of all the rest of the family to one-third.</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;</p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The history of Ireland, during the Penal Days, is dark and
gloomy enough. Occasionally we find great utterances from noble Protestant men
in behalf of the general rights of the kingdom ; such as Molyneux’ <i>Case of
Ireland, Swift’s </i>Drapier Letters, and Dr. Charles Lucas’s persistent
protestations against the encroachments on the Constitution. Molyneux’ brave
little book was burned by the common hangman ; a reward was offered for the
discovery of the Drapier, and his printer arrested ; and Lucas had to exile
himself into England, to escape the laws enacted by and for the English interest
in Ireland. A still stranger commentary on the laws of those days is afforded by
the fact that the principles for which Lucas bad to fly from Ireland were
extolled in England, and drew from such a cast-iron Tory as Samuel Johnson, the
strongest encomiums. Indeed, Johnson’s allusions to Lucas are</p>
<b>
<p ALIGN="CENTER">HISTORICAL INTRODUCTION. 19</p>
<p ALIGN="CENTER">&nbsp;</p>
</b>
<p ALIGN="CENTER">quoted to show that the former was greatly misrepresented by
those who regarded him as &quot;abjectly submissive to power.&quot; &quot; Let
the man,&quot; says Johnson, &quot;thus driven into exile, for having been the
friend of his country, be received in every other place as the confessor of
liberty; and let the tools of power be taught in time, that they may rob, but
cannot impoverish.&quot;</p>
<p ALIGN="CENTER">Though having a patriotic purpose none of the endeavors of
those able men might be accounted national in the correct sense of that idea.
Molyneux’ was perhaps the most so, though Swift’s subtle, blunt, and
polished philippics against the introduction of Wood’s half-pence, created the
most universal excitement, and succeeded in accomplishing the object sought. The
labors of those trusty men are famous because they were famous in their day.
They were ahead of their surroundings in vigor of conception and boldness of
expression, and deserve all praise. It remained, however, for Theobald Wolfe
Tone to give a positive character to the Irish mind in politics. Other and able
men looked to concessions. He alone regarded Rights.</p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">They were hampered by illustrating ideas which in various
forms already existed. Basing his views solely on the Rights of Ireland, and not
contemplating the welfare of England, with which he deemed he had no</p>
<b>
<p>20 FENIAN HEROES AND MARTYRS.</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">concern,<b> </b>Tone breathed a new life into and unveiled a
vast and fresh purpose to those who desired the benefit of the Irish people in
Ireland. Others had fought parties, and for successes which left large portions
of the people in as dark despondency and degradation as before. Tone labored to
unite all, and as he said, to substitute the common name of Irishman in place of
the distinctions which had been used to keep them asunder. He withstood the
temptations of mere politics as a means of personal advancement, and discarded
the overtures made to him by leading parliamentarians of the day. The ground
upon which they stood was confined, the prospect presented was narrow, because
the purposes contemplated were selfish and purely self-reflective.</p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">When Tone surveyed the state of Ireland he saw her inferior
to no country in Europe in the gifts of nature; blest with a temperate sky and a
fruitful soil; intersected by many great rivers ; indented round her whole coast
with the noblest harbors; abounding with all the materials for unlimited
commerce; teeming with inexhaustible mines of the most useful metals; filled by
four millions of an ingenious and gallant people-with bold hearts and ardent
spirits; posted right in the track between Europe and America, within fifty
miles of England and three hundred of France; yet with all these great
advantages &quot;unheard of and un-</p>

army or navy; not of half the consequence in the empire, of which she has the
honor to make a part, with the single county of York, or the loyal and
well-regulated town of Birmingham.&quot; He truly argued these were mortifying
considerations.</p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The so-called &quot;revolution&quot; of 1782 lead been
accomplished. Henry Grattan, backed by the arms of the volunteers, had wrung
from England the concession that no power had the right to make laws for Ireland
but the King, Lords, and Commons thereof; but the Irish Parliament became only
the shadow of the English one. The achievement of Grattan left the power on a
broader basis than before in the hands of the Protestant ascendancy. Tone read
aright the effects of the &quot;revolution;&quot; and had the copra e to speak
the truth about it. Eight years after it had been on trial, he says : &quot;The
Revolution of 1782 was a Revolution which enabled Irishmen to sell, at a much
higher price, their honor, their integrity, and the interests of their country;
it was a Revolution, which, while at one stroke it doubled the value of every
borough-monger in the kingdom, left three-fourths of our countrymen slaves as it
found them, and the Government of Ireland in the base and wicked and
contemptible hands, who had spent their lives in degrading and plundering her;
nay, some of whom had given their</p>

famous Revolution. Who of the veteran enemies of the country lost his place or
his pension? Who was called forth to station or office from the ranks of the
Opposition? Not one I The power remained in the hands of our enemies, again to
be exerted for our ruin, with this difference, that formerly we had our
distresses, our injuries, and our insults gratis, at the hands of England; but
now we pay very dearly to receive the same with aggravation, through the hands
of Irishmen; yet this we boast of, and call a Revolution!&quot;</p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This revolution concentrated power in the hands of the
aristocracy and lifted no weight from the necks of the people. The position of
the three great classes into which the inhabitants of the island were divided
will show to any candid mind the truth and force of Tone's deductions.</p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Protestant party had been for more than a century in easy
enjoyment of the church, the law, the revenue, the army, the navy, the
magistracy, the corporations, and all institutions receiving or extending
patronage. Not one-tenth of the population, and descended from foreign
plunderers and usurpers, they alone beheld security in maintaining. an English
interest in Ireland; and England, profiting by their weaknesses, augmented their
fears, kept them in a state of perpetual trepidation, gave them her protection,

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">took in<b> </b>exchange the commerce and the liberties of
Ireland. The events of the American Revolution emboldened the Catholics and
Presbyterians, and forced the Protestants into some slightly beneficial measures
of redress, but they remained attached to their protectors, a party property, an
aristocracy.</p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Dissenters -- double in numbers to the Protestants --
were chiefly manufacturers and traders, and did not believe their existence
depended on the immutability of their slavishness to England. &quot;Strong in
their numbers and their courage, they felt that they were able to defend
themselves, and they soon ceased to<b> </b>consider themselves as any other than
Irishmen.&quot; They formed the flower of the Volunteer Army of '82, ,and were
the first to demand Reform.</p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Catholics were numerically the most formidable, embracing
as they did, the peasantry of three provinces, and a considerable portion of the
business class. The exactions of the Penal Laws had left them but a small
proportion of the landed interest. &quot;There was no injustice, no disgrace, no
disqualification, moral, political or religious, civil or military, that was not
heaped upon them.&quot; Under such a system, it is no wonder that the peasantry
were both morally and physically degraded, and the spirit of the few remaining
gentry broken.</p>

<b>

</b>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">of civil and religious liberty. The overwhelming injustice of
their position appealed powerfully to his sense of right as a man as well as an
Irish-born man. His desire was to unite them with the Dissenters, and thus
present to the party representing the government and the evils of English
connection, a broad, popular front on which toleration would be written in
letters of light. His objects and means were thus lucidly indicated. &quot; To
subvert the tyranny of our execrable government, to break the connection with
England, the never-failing source of all our political evils, and to assert the
independence of my country-these were my objects. To unite the whole people of
Ireland, to abolish the memory of all past dissensions, and to substitute the
common name of Irishman, in place of the denominations of Protestant, Catholic
and Dissenter -these were my means.&quot;</p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Here we have the well-defined plan upon which the Society of
The United Irishmen was founded. It was a bold and mighty step towards a true
nationality to disentangle politics from religion in those days. Tone's plan
surmounted the sectional difficulties which had made the island for centuries
alternately a prey to remorseless depredation on the one hand, and as savage
retribution on the other. To unite the elements descended from such recklessly
discordant parentage -- to lift them out of their age -- fostered and
blood-anoint-</p>

<p>passions, into a passion for an ennobling common object -- to bind them as
close in friendship as they had been knit in fight, was an original, daring,
and, judged by the obstacles to be overcome, almost sublime scheme.</p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Tone founded the first Society of United Irishmen, on<b> </b>the
12th October, 1791. On the 12th October, 1798, the seventh anniversary of the
foundation of practical patriotism in Ireland, lie was captured on board the <i>Hoche</i>,<i>
</i>74<i> </i>guns, the admiral's ship of a portion of the third expedition he
had projected in France and Hamburg, for the aid of Ireland. Between those dates
a wonderfully inspiring history was enacted in Ireland. United Irishism spread
into all ranks, inflaming alike Catholic peasants and Protestant peers with a
divine fervor, and bringing round the common altar of their country noble
clergymen of every denomination. The Rev. William Jackson, a Protestant
clergyman, undertook to sound the Irish in 1795, on the<b> </b>subject of an
alliance with France, was betrayed By an English attorney, and died in the dock.
Messrs. Warwick, Stevelly, and William Porter, Presbyterian clergymen, were
hanged. Rev. William Steele Dickson of the same denomination, who had been the
early asserter of Ireland's independence and advocate of his Catholic
fellow-countrymen, was, for nearly two years, adjutant-General of the United
Irish of Ulster. &quot; Bet-</p>

<p ALIGN="CENTER">ter die courageously in the field than be butchered in the
houses,&quot; said Father John Murphy, putting himself at the head of his flock,
after the yeoman had burned his chapel over his head, in May '98. The royalists
did not know the flame they were kindling, when they set fire to the little
chapel of Boolavogue. &quot;We must conquer or perish&quot; cried this
priest-leader to his pikemen, at Oulart Hill, and they conquered. This reverend
General Murphy was heard from at the battle of Enniscorthy, at Vinegar Hill, and
other tough conflicts : as also were Father Philip Roche, who commanded at the
bloody fight at Tubberneering, where Col. Walpole fell, and was subsequently
elected generalissimo of the Wexford troops; and the soldier-priests, Moses
Kearns and Nicholas Redmond, who drove Col. L'Estrange and his dragoons into
Newtownbarry, and even had the audacity to engage and rout the garrison of over
five hundred troops. Kearns subsequently made a desperate defence of Enniscorthy
against General Johnston, and carried a serious wound from the fight, which led
to his capture. Father Clinch, with those named, was one of the leaders of the
patriots on the great but disastrous day of Vinegar Hill. Another prominent and
brave priest-leader was Father Michael Murphy. The history of the patriot
priests of '98 affords a thrilling chapter, which should be separately set forth
for the sake of the noble</p>

by inhuman barbarity and oppression, they made common cause with their
persecuted flocks. They showed them how to fight` on the field ; and ]<sub>lo</sub>w<sub>
</sub>to die, if need be, on the scaffold, as did Roche, John Murphy, Learns,
Redmond, Prendergast, Quigley, and others. Father Michael Murphy was vouchsafed
the nobler death on the field, being torn to pieces by a cannon-ball while
leading on a division of pikemen at the battle of Arklow.</p>
<p ALIGN="left" style="line-height: 100%">The war for national independence,
projected by the United Irishmen, was forced into a premature explosion by the
government. On the 30th March, 17.)8, Lord Camden, the viceroy, proclaimed all
Ireland under Martial Law. The proclamation was a brutal incentive to riot.
Armed with it the military and &quot; authorities&quot; went about the country
exasperating suspected localities, creating feuds for the sake of punishing
individuals, and involving individuals that whole districts might be plundered.
What was true, of one locality was but too true of all. &quot; The inhuman
tortures instituted by the yeomen, the barbarities inflicted without regard to
age or sex, the scourgings, pitch-caps, house-burnings, and murders, then drew a
distinct and bloody line between those who acted fur, and under the protection
of, the government and the people. No man was safe, no woman invio-</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">While the people on the one hand were goaded into unbearable
agony, the leaders of the people on the other hand were seized, hanged,
banished, put out of the way with indiscriminate fury. The betrayal of the <i>plans
and </i>several prominent leaders by the infamous Thomas Reynolds, the Arnold of
Ireland, on the eve of the rising, with the distraction which followed was an
irreparable blow to the project. Judged by the light which documentary history
has thrown on the period, the chances of success of the United Irishmen loom
into very great proportions, while the destinies of England seem to <i>have </i>been
held by a very slender thread. Madden is right when lie says of the United Irish
Society, that &quot; whether viewed in its results, the character of its
members, or the nature of its proceedings, it may certainly be regarded as a
confederacy which no political or revolutionary society that has gone before it
has surpassed in importance, boldness of <i>design, </i>and devotion to its
principles.&quot; On the other hand, England's incontrovertible danger may be
judged from the fact that had either one of Tone's</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">expeditions been favored with a fair wind<i> </i>to carry it
to its destination, England could not have held Ireland, and half of her
prestige would have been gone. It is not disputed that England was saved by the
elements that scattered Tone's expeditions. The active civil war lasted less
than five months, that is from the rising of the people, 20th May, to the
capture of Tone, but its extent, and the vigor with which it was sustained may
be comprehended from its cost to the people and the government. The English
employed 137,000 men to suppress the &quot; insurrection.&quot; Its cost in
money is variously estimated at thirty millions and fifty millions pounds
sterling. The English lost twenty thousand men ; the Irish fifty thousand. The
royalists received one and a half millions sterling for damages to property. No
estimate can be made of the damage perpetrated on the property of the people. It
may<b> </b>be<b> </b>indicated by the fact that the Catholic churches burned, of
which any account was kept, amounted to sixty-nine. This, as Madden says, &quot;
may afford some criterion by which we can judge of the number and extent&quot;
of other outrages on property belonging to persons of that communion.</p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The &quot;Union&quot; followed the &quot;rebellion,&quot; and
in the reckless<b> </b>corruption and infamy by which it was carried was a
fitting sequel to the murderous barbarity by which the latter was precipitated
and concluded.</p>
<b>

</b>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Twenty-one years before the Union was effected, Samuel
Johnson well characterized the <i>animus </i>which would and did govern England
in seeking it. &quot; Artful politicians,&quot; as Boswell characterizes them,
had often in view a Union between Ireland and England, and in 1779, Johnson,
expressing himself on the subject to a gentleman from Ireland, said : &quot;Do
not make a Union with us, sir. We should unite with you only to rob you.&quot;*
As Johnson indicated the spirit of rapine which would follow a Union, so Byron,
twelve years after its accomplishment, stigmatized and illustrated the rapacious
dishonesty of the measure. &quot;Adieu,&quot; said lie, &quot;to that Union
so-called, as <i>lucus a non lucendo, </i>a Union from never uniting, which, in
its first operation, gave a death-blow to the independence of Ireland, and in
its last may be the cause of her eternal separation from this country. If it
must be called a<sup> </sup>Union, it is the union of the shark with its prey;
the spoiler swallows up his victim, and thus they become one and indivisible.
Thus has Great Britain swallowed up the parliament, the constitution, the
independence of Ireland, and refuses to disgorge even a single privilege,
although for the relief of her swollen and distempered body politic.&quot;**</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The manner in which the Catholic peasantry were butchered in
'98 to put down the rebellion, and the style in which the Protestant
&quot;gentry&quot; were bought and sold in 1800, to effect the Union, were
equally disgraceful, and proclaimed as loud as desperate deeds could proclaim
that Ireland was not the patient slave of England, and that there was not, and
could not exist a mutually beneficial or respected union between them. After
quartering her native and Hessian mercenaries on the devoted people of Ireland,
England quartered with much parade the arms of Ireland on the British Flag this
too while the wanton agonies, inflicted by the former, were fermenting into
vengeance, which took form in a few years afterwards in what is known as Emmet's
Rebellion, and which was, although nobly inspired and well conceived, but a
faint echo of the great fight in '98.</p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In Paris, where Robert Emmet spent the early autumn of 1802,
deep in military studies, he met his brother Thomas Addis, and the exiles of
'98, including some of the students who had been expelled with him from the
University of Dublin, for national reasons. Irish affairs naturally engrossed
their attention, especially as the relations between France and England were not
of the most amicable nature. He had interviews with Buonaparte and Talleyrand,
from which he hopefully speculated, inasmuch as the patched-up peace</p>

the former and intrigues of the latter, be of long duration. lie had not much
faith in the actual sympathy of either of those personages; but felt that under
the inspiration which guided both, the disruption of Ireland would be a grand
point towards furthering the projects of France against England. Of Buonaparte's
temporary sincerity to aid Ireland under the exigencies of his mission he had no
doubt. &quot;He thought, however, that Talleyrand rather desired the
establishment of an independent republic in Ireland, and that Buonaparte did
not. The object of the latter was to aggrandize France, and to damage England;
and so far as <i>that </i>object went, to wish well to any effort in Ireland
that might be auxiliary to his purpose.&quot; Thus the political movements-the
&quot;dreadful notes of preparation&quot; for war-in both France and England,
under favor of the temporary treaty of Amiens, dated March 27th, 1802-the
evasive diplomacy indulged in by the statesmen of the two powers -the virulent
abuse of Buonaparte by the leading English journals, and the unsatisfied demands
of M. Otto, the French Minister at London, touching the Bourbon princes and the
French emigrants in England, and his protestations against those &quot;
obnoxious, seditious and unbecoming publications&quot; upon the French leader,
fully convinced the hopeful and brooding Irish exiles</p>

<p>HISTORICAL INTRODUCTION. 33</p>
</b>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">that<b> </b>war was inevitable, The fire of '98 was still
smouldering on many a bleak and disquieted hearthstone in Ireland. There were
sad and angry wailings through Irish vales and glens -- cries from the unshriven
dead and the unappeased living to heaven or earth, or anywhere, for vengeance.
There were horrible memories in men's minds-memories all the more desperate that
they were pent up-and to such memories, and for the men who held them, war-war
from any<i> </i>quarter, so that it was against England, was as giving speech to
the dumb and light to the captive.</p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The design on Ireland was not that of Robert Emmet solely.
All the Irish exiles in Paris and Belgium, with the exception of Arthur
O'Connor, appear to have been engaged in it, or cognizant of the fact. Of the
party in Paris, Thomas Russell had the most influence, if we are to judge by the
memoirs of O'Connor, to whom the French Government communicated the project. The
conspiracy was well laid in Ireland also, men of prominence and distinction,
including some noblemen, giving it certain, if secret, sanction. In Emmet's
speech, he declares he was the instrument, the willing instrument, however, of
men before the splendor of whose genius and virtues he bowed with respectful
deference. He emphatically and more than once denied that his purpose was to
transfer Ireland from the hand of England to the grasp of France.</p>
<b>
<p>34 FENIAN HEROES AND MARTYRS.</p>
</b>
<p>In his written communication with Buonaparte, Addis Emmet also, in
unmistakable language, scouted the</p>
<p>idea that the Irish would accept aid on any such terms. It never was the idea
of any of the Irish revolutionists. Impressed by the anxious representations
from Ireland the majority of the exiles concur red in a co-operative movement
when France would be ready to strike England on leer own account; and from his
connections, enthusiasm, and ability, Robert Emmet became the leading agent in
the movement.</p>
<p>William Lawless accompanied Emmet to Ireland; Thomas Russell, regarding whom
Tone said, &quot;I think the better of myself for being the object of esteem of
such a man,&quot; and who had but just quitted his prison at Fort George, went
to Ireland to lead the men of the North, over which district he was appointed.
General-in-Chief. Putnam M'Cabe's presence in the country was made memorable by
his felicitous escape from the soldiery at Belfast. Michael Dwyer was at the
head of a brave band of mountaineers in Wicklow. Nicholas <i>Gray, </i>Bagnal
Harvey's aide-de-camp in Wexford in '98, was in the movement. The indefatigable
James Hope, the weaver of Temple Patrick, who had been the secret agent of the
leaders of '98, and who, with M'Cracken, led the insurgents at the gallant fight
at Antrim, was still unceasing in his allegiance to the</p>
<p>national cause.</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">So far as I can discover, all the funds at Emmet's disposal
amounted to about seventeen thousand dollars -ten of which comprised all his own
fortune ; the other seven thousand being contributed by Philip Long, a patriotic
and wealthy tradesman of Dublin, who entered fully into the conspiracy.</p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The principles held by Emmet were those of Wolfe Tone. Like
Tone, too, young Emmet's energy was inexhaustibly great. No man who reflects on
his career will fail to be struck with the irrepressible vigor with which he
carried on his preparations; now planning, now superintending his various
depots, and the manufacture of arms. In one of these places he slept on a
mattress on the floor, that he might be always present to oversee what was going
forward, to animate his workmen, and to meet any emergency that might arise to
demand the governing power of his presence, or the inspiration of his example.</p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The accidental blowing up of a powder depot, on the 16th
July, 1803, drew attention to the conspiracy, and precipitated events to a
fruitless end. In fact, with that explosion, United Irishism was blown into
fragments for more than two generations. The dogs of the street licked the blood
of Emmet from the pavement under his scaffold, his body was hidden in an
un-inscribed grave, and upon the ruins of those efforts for a distinct idea of
nationality, arose, and in greater</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">proportions, the fabric of a sectional agitation. This
agitation was needed; but it was not all that was needed. The United Irishmen
had started the agitation of Catholic rights on broad national grounds. In
taking up the theme, O'Connell circumscribed both. The United Irishmen labored
to create a spirit of toleration between all denominations. O'Connell did not
think this essential ; was the belligerent and powerful advocate of one and the
ready and defiant antagonist of all others. Gifted with great ability and vast
and subtle knowledge of the people, both combined to make him the leader by
reflecting the humor, appealing to the misery, defying the enemies, and, by
giving expression to the passions of his countrymen, which had acquired rancor
and vindictiveness from having been so long choked in silence.<br>
That the agitation for Catholic Emancipation was needed, all admit ; that it was
not, all that was needed no rational being will deny. Subsequent agitation for
the Repeal of the Union proved that more was wanting than such emancipation as
was vouchsafed to the Irish Catholics. In advocating Repeal, Davis succintly
epitomizes what was achieved by the one and what is embraced in the other</p>

  the sacrifice of the forty-shilling freeholders -- the poor veterans of the
  warand by submission to insulting oaths; yet it was cheaply bought. Not so
  cheaply, perchance, as if won by the sword ; for, on it were expended more
  treasures, more griefs, more intellect, more passion, more of all which makes
  life welcome, than had been needed for war ; still it was cheaply bought, and
  Ireland has glorified herself, and will through ages triumph in the victory of
  '29.</p>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;Yet what was Emancipation compared to Repeal?</p>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;The one put a silken badge on a few members of one
  profession ; the other would give to all professions and all trades the rank
  and riches which resident proprietors, domestic legislation, and flourishing
  commerce, infallibly create.</p>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;Emancipation made it possible for Catholics to sit on
  the judgment seat; but it left a foreign administration, which has excluded
  them, save in two or three cases, where over-topping eminence made the
  acceptance of a Judgeship no promotion ; and it left the local judges-those
  with whom the people has to deal as partial, ignorant, and bigoted as ever;
  while Repeal would give us an Irish code and Irish-hearted Judges in every
  Court, from the Chancery to the Petty Sessions.</p>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;Emancipation dignified a dozen Catholics with a
  senatorial name in a foreign and hostile Legislature. Repeal would give us a
  Senate, a Militia, an Administration, all our own.</p>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;The Penal Code, as it existed since 1793, insulted
  the faith of the Catholics, restrained their liberties, and violated the
  public Treaty of Limerick. The Union has destroyed our manufactures, prohibits
  our flag, prevents our commerce, drains our rental, crushes our genius, makes
  our taxation a tribute, our representation a shadow, our name a bye-word. It

Grattan's. Both brought peculiarly powerful inspirations into politics, and the

animated by Grattan and the volunteers was a potent element in the formation of
United Irishism, and its struggle in '98; and the talent which rallied round the

led to the attempted revolution in '48. Grattan had said &quot;Liberty with

when they deemed the period for policy had passed, and the era for honesty
arrived, the progressive Volunteers became United Irishmen, to carry out
Grattan's idea&quot; Perish the British Empire-live and the Young Ireland
Repealers became Irish Confederates to carry out O'Connell's declaration of
&quot;Ireland for the Irish.&quot; Grattan lived to his country reduced to that
condition in which O'Connell's maturity found her, and, dying in London, his
ashes enhance the memories of the pantheon of Ireland’s oppressors-he was

associates and the old chief was inevitable. Davis was a concentration of

said, &quot;Love of country was the passion of his life-the motive for every
action-the foundation of every feeling.&quot; With characteristic force, as
indicating his creative power of patriotism, Doheny said, Davis &quot;Struck
living fire from inert way-side stones. To him the meanest rill, the rugged
mountains, the barren waste, the rudest fragment of barbaric history, spoke the
language of elevation, harmony and hope.&quot; Meagher's first speech was a
sweet tribute in honor of the dead, and upon the fresh grave of his friend, John
Mitchel laid as a dedicatory offering the first fruits of his labors in Irish
literature 'the life of Aodh O'Neill.</p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">After remonstrating in vain with the O'Connellites, the Young
Ireland party received great accessions of strength, and on the, 13th January,
1847, formed the &quot;Irish Confederation.&quot; This organization was a
brilliant representative of Irish honor and intellectual attainment. The genius
and enthusiasm of the country rallied round it. The great journal, <i>The
Nation, </i>which had fostered all the national resources, in whatever form they
presented themselves, had a legitimate offspring at maturity in the
Confederation. <i>The Nation </i>had attracted the applause of Europe and
America as the spirit of progressive Ireland : the Confederation disclosed the
active body behind it.</p>

<p ALIGN="CENTER">HISTORICAL INTRODUCTION. 41</p>
</b>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In<b> </b>intellectual endowments the &quot;Young
Ireland&quot; party will compare favorably with the men of '98, with one
exception. That exception is Tone. As a political writer lie was alone in his
day. He has not been equalled since. He was not only a patriot but a statesman
and diplomat; a combination rarely to be found. lie was not only almost
inexhaustibly suggestive, but he was also practical. He differed from most men
who have one grand idea, in the fact that he never put the attainment of his
object <b>in </b>jeopardy by publicly ignoring the sense of those who had other
ideas or differed from his. While he was firm he was also considerate. To this
faculty may be attributed the power he had with men. His pamphlets are
characterized by fervor and argument, never by abuse. Thomas Davis, however, had
one<b> </b>great advantage over Tone in seizing the popular heart, and throbbing
it with healthy and indignant pulsations, he was a poet. Ills prose essays are
abundantly illustrative of noble aspirations and ready gifts, but his poems are
passionately national, and contain that fire which cannot be extinguished,</p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">If the members of the Irish Confederation, taken as a party,
were not only equal to, but beyond the United Irishmen, as poets, orators, and
publicists, they were far behind them as revolutionists. It may be that from the
formation of the Confederation,</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">time was not permitted to develop the revolutionary ability
of the body until it was extinct ; and it is true that foreign example,
especially the French Revolution, and the writings of John Mitchel, forced the
leaders, and, through them, the people into a position not contemplated as so
closely imminent. The Confederation was not a secret or oath-bound organization
as the United Irish Society was. It might have become so had it lived longer.
The United Irish Society was twice as long in existence before it took refuge in
secrecy from the persecution of the government, and reorganized on a military
basis. Originally started to effect Catholic Emancipation and Parliamentary
Reform, it was persecuted into the wider field of Republicanism. The
Confederation was designed to educate and organize the people-to achieve Repeal
by moral force, if possible; by physical force, if necessary.</p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The famine years had been regarded by English ministers as
powerful allies for the reduction of the Irish. Measures of relief were
suggested in and out of Parliament, resolutions carried, committees appointed,
discussions held as to what caused the famine? How far the potato blight had
gone? How could it be stayed? Science grew blind experimenting; and the groans
of the dying, which maddened the Irish only made the ministers deaf. Although</p>
<b>
<p ALIGN="CENTER">HISTORICAL INTRODUCTION 43</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;</p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">there was not a county in Ireland which had escaped the
potato-rot, and the consequent scarcity of food and funds, yet the landlords
were as unrelenting as ever in driving and grinding the impoverished peasantry.
Meanwhile, the island'was rifled of its grain and cattle to meet the exigencies
of the absentees and the English interest in Ireland ; t yd the Government, to
make a show of charity and protection to the world, bought up some foreign corn
for the &quot; poor Irish.&quot; It might have bought the food in the country,
and distributed it; but that would have been the means of circulating money and
staving off famine; and neither of these appliances were calculated to sustain
an English interest in Ireland. No ! every vessel seeking the doomed island with
foreign corn &quot;was sure to meet half a dozen sailing out with Irish wheat
and cattle.&quot; There was no end to the meetings of learned bodies, and the
reports they made. Every thing was done but the one thing necessary--feed the
people.</p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Where famine and fever did not put the peasantry beyond the
power of injuring the English interest,&quot; agrarian outrages,&quot; as the
desire for food was called, brought them within the clutches of the law. The
process was complete, and none will say it was not powerful. First, the people
were systematically starved ; and for those who escaped death, the minis-</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">ters supplied a trap in the shape of the Coercion (Agrarian
Outrages) Bill, to restrain the daring which gave them a desire to live.
&quot;Old Ireland&quot; had gone with the Whigs, and the Whigs had gone against
Ireland, as usual, notwithstanding the promises of beneficial measures, by which
Lord John Russell had duped the Old Repeal Association. &quot;Agrarian
outrage&quot; was the plea made to excuse Whig concessions on the one hand ; and
on the other, to declare in Parliament that it were better to &quot;outrage the
Constitution,&quot; than allow the present state of affairs to continue in
Ireland.</p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In the face of these actions, the Irish Confederation had
work enough on hand, were it equal to the occasion. But it was not. Although it
had, on the statement of its secretary, upwards of one hundred and fifty
thousand enrolled men in the clubs,* yet the Confederate organization was far
from perfect, and the amount of arms possessed by it insignificant. Inspired, as
it was, by a noble sense of nationality, still the distinct purposes of the
Confederacy were not widely defined or understood. The opinion of the body of
its members was in a transition state, between the old principles they had left,
and the new ones which were not fully adopted. This led to differences</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">among some of the leaders, and suggested the necessity of a
definite programme of guidance in the Confederation. Mitchel, not seeing
anything in the famine policy of the Government but &quot; a machinery
deliberately devised and skilfully worked for the entire subjugation of the
island,-the slaughter of a portion of its people, and the pauperization of the
rest,&quot; believed that resistance should be opposed to the system at every
point : that the transport and shipment of provisions should be obstructed and
rendered impossible : and that the people should be advised <i>not </i>to give
up their arms, under the law made to disarm them, but to provide more,
especially pikes, of which the soldiery were in great horror. O'Brien, Duffy,
and the <i>Nation, </i>party remonstrated against this course, as it would be a
virtual declaration of war. On the two days debate which followed in the
Confederation, Meagher gave the weight of his popularity, and turned the scale
against Mitchel's views ; and Mitchel having already retired from the <i>Nation </i>set
up the <i>United Irishman, </i>to promulgate the doctrines he thought best
suited to the crisis. Throughout these movements Devin Reilly was the able
lieutenant of Mitchel.</p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The French Revolution of February, 1848, created great
excitement in Ireland, giving a new impetus to the Confederation, and apparently
ratifying the</p>

</b>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">republican indications of Mitchel. The Confederate orators
now rivalled the revolutionary vigor of the <i>United Irishman. </i>In the first
week in February the assembled Confederates voted down Mitchel's war programme:
a month afterwards, Meagher, the voice</p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">of the Confederation, declared that if the Government did not
accede to the demand for the reconstruction of Irish Nationality, he was ready
to cry &quot;up with the barricades, and invoke the god of battles.&quot; The
Confederation also sent an address to France, which declared that her heroism
&quot;taught enslaved nations that emancipation ever awaits those who dared to
achieve it by their own intrepidity.&quot; These significant expressions were
seized with avidity by the people, as indicating a desire to fight. If the Whig
Ministers affected to treat the Irish movement with contempt, the Tory leaders
forced them out of that position. The Earl of Derby, in the House of Lords,
called the Government to task, and said of the Irish leaders, &quot;These men
are honest ; they are not the kind of men who make their patriotism the means of
barter for place or pension.&quot; The Whigs, disgusted at the Tories calling
the Confederates honest and high-toned, determined to render their cause as
degrading as English law could make it. The Treason-Felony Act was therefore
passed. What was heretofore known as treason to the Crown,</p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;</p>
<b>
<p ALIGN="CENTER">HISTORICAL INTRODUCTION. 47</p>
</b>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">which in Ireland was regarded as patriotism, was by this Act
made a felony and the patriots &quot;felons.&quot;</p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The arrest of John Mitchel quickly followed, and the national
excitability seemed to culminate in the idea that now was the time for a general
uprising. The Council of the Confederation, after the most strenuous exertions,
prevented an outbreak, and excused its action in an Address to the People. The
Council feared that an attempt to rescue Mitchel, and to free Ireland, would
prove abortive. &quot; We, therefore,&quot; said the Address, &quot; interposed,
and with difficulty succeeded in preventing the fruitless effusion of
blood.&quot; Mitchel was permitted to be banished; and the Government, seeing
the Confederates waver at the very crisis of the excitement, pushed matters with
its usual recklessness and vigor. The <i>Irish Tribune </i>sprang into the gap
made by the demolition of the</p>
<i>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">United Irishman, and, </i>two weeks after, the <i>Irish Felon
</i>was by the side of the former laboring for the</p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">same ends. &quot;The harvest,&quot; was now the cry of the
patriots. &quot; Wait for the harvest, and we will, in God's name, strike a
blow.&quot; The Government, however, would not wait so long. All its power was
put forth to force a rising, that it might crush it. The <i>Tribune,</p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Felon, </i>and <i>Nation </i>were seized, and the editors and
proprietors thrown into prison. The Gagging Act prevented the leaders from
addressing the Clubs in</p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;</p>
<b>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">FENIAN HEROES AND MARTYRS.</p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;</p>
</b>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">the cities ; and the suspension of the <i>Habeas Corpus</i>Act
compelled those who had rendered themselves objects of suspicion, to evade the
authorities. Thus these men were thrown on the country, when they had helped to
chill its spirit, or make it irresolute by hope deferred. The leaders had to
&quot;take to the hills.&quot; Rewards were offered for the more prominent, and
the natural gallantry and truth of the Irish peasant created a sympathy where
even a knowledge of the political situation had been but imperfectly understood.
Hunted with celerity they strove to face the emergency in hurried councils, and
with undisciplined material, and having come in contact with the British forces
at the Slate Quarries, Mullinahone, Killenaule, Ballingarry, Abbeyfeale, and
other places, they were either captured or found safety in escape and exile. Of
the chief men, O'Brien and Meagher were captured, tried, found guilty, and
sentenced to death, which was subsequently commuted to banishment for life; and
Doheny, Dillon, Devin Reilly, O'Gorman and others, after various adventures,
escaped, and found their way to America. Later in the year, in September, a more
persistent effort was made by Messrs. O'Mahony and Savage to rally the people in
Tipperary, Waterford and Kilkenny, and to retrieve somewhat the disasters that
had preceded. After demonstrations on the mountains of these localities, and</p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;</p>
<b>
<p ALIGN="CENTER">HISTORICAL INTRODUCTION 49</p>
</b>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">conflicts at Portlaw barracks, Glenbower, Scaugh, and other
places, the movement was given up as hope back calmly at the events of '48, and
comprehending details which only time can present in their true light, there can
he no rational doubt of the fact that the people were not prepared to attempt or
effect a revolution by arms that<i> </i>year. There was no organization; the
Confederation was not sufficiently long in existence to have put the country on
a fighting basis; and Without organization nothing could he elected. The French
Revolution came too soon for the good of Ireland. There were moments when a shot
would have set the revolution going with an <i>esprit </i>and a fervor, the
result of which cannot be imagined.</p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The 10th July was such an occasion, when the populace of
Waterford and Cashel raised barricades to prevent the arrest of Meagher and
Doheny. It needed Meagher's most impassioned exertions to free himself from his
friends, that he might be arrested by his enemies. Doheny was taken out of jail
by the Cashel men, recaptured himself, and only was permitted to do so by
pledging his word that he was arrested on a bailable offence. Both, unknown to
each other, feared to precipitate a revolt, because the leaders had no settled
plan of action. The chief occasion</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">of the year, however, was the trial of Mitchel. The leaders
were all at liberty, and the enthusiasm of the people intense and manageable.
The Government had shown its vindictive intentions, which created as daring a
desire of defiance, and the halo encircling the first martyr inspired the masses
of the Dublin clubs with a frenzy which declined after the disappointments of
that day.</p>

people to appreciate organization, which, powerful at all times, is all the
grander and snore reliable when founded on and sustained by intelligence.</p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Philosophically judged, Young Ireland achieved a notable and
fruitful victory. On the one land it compelled England to show the ruflian hand
by which the &quot;sister island&quot; was governed. This was not lost on the
world; the French Government adroitly alluded to it in 1860, when Persigny was
&quot;enlarging the liberty&quot; of the French Press. On the other ]land it
bestowed a new literature on the country, which commanded even the admiration of
its enemies, and is the touchstone of all literary endeavor in Ireland since.
Irishmen who could not embrace the politics of Young Ireland, welcomed the
literature which seemed to combine the best characteristics of all that had gone
before, with an informing spirit emanating from pure hearts and able heads.</p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Even in the disruption of the party, its scattered elements
were destined to do wondrous service in testimony of the national faith and
character of Irishmen, and of continued tribulation to the Government of
Ireland. Those who were kept in jail under the suspension of the <i>Habeas

<p>they were planning and projecting, with other untiring spirits, a renewal of
armed hostilities in 1849.*</p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The exiles who were in France took advantage of the disrupted
state of that country, to study successful means of revolution, and to interest
many able Frenchmen in the Irish cause-no very difficult matter to be sure, as
in addition to the sympathy between the Irish and French, descending from old
military alliances, anything against England is attractive to a true Frenchman.
The exiles in America, in the press, the lecture-hall, the drill-room, possessed
welcome vehicles for the expression and expansion of the doctrines which had
driven them from home; and even in the penal colonies, to which England had
banished those who had fallen into the embrace of partisan judges and packed
juries, the gallant settlers received as friends those who were branded as
felons, and intrigued and conspired to set them free.</p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It would be impossible, even were all the materials at hand,
to present at this date anything like a fair record of the unceasing, though
sometimes contracted efforts made in Ireland and America to keep alive one
organization after the other for the encouragement and indoctrination of Irish
national principles. The history of these efforts, when written, will prove of
deep interest, and give evidence of the undying devo-</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">tion of all classes of Irishmen to the freedom of their
native land.</p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Distracted, now by differences of able men, now by the
jealousies of weak ones; at other times by the well-meant officiousness of
ignorance; again by the want of means, and the bickering results of such a
condition; sometimes falling into apathy by the dropping out of some earliest
spirit, whose sensitiveness would pall before an accumulation of the visitations
described, it is remarkable that some one was always found to cheer, to
encourage, and give life and vigor to a nucleus of nationalists. The connection
was thus kept up, sometimes by a happily-welded link, at others by a very
fragile rope indeed. I have chiefly referred to the projective societies in New
York, with which the congenial societies in Ireland were in communication.</p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">One great source of dissatisfaction arose from the very
hopefulness which kept the cause alive in Ireland, and which led men there to
exaggerate the means at their disposal. The mistaken idea, also prevailing in
Ireland, of the position of the exiles in America. who, it was thought, could
control any amount of money and war material, caused the demands made on them to
be of an equally-extensive character. It is needless to say, these demands could
not be complied with. The existence of those societies</p>

<p>was always precarious, sometimes exciting, but all were guided by worthy
aspirations.</p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Fenian organization was the result of the societies which
had preceded it. The most imposing of them had fallen away, and the nucleus from
which sprung this formidable power was composed of Michael Doheny, Michael
Corcoran, John O'Mahony, and one or two others. From small numerical dimensions
it slowly but steadily expanded to the form in which it has arrested the
attention of the world.</p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">When O'Mahony was elected president of the society, and at
the same time received his commission as Head Centre from elsewhere, toward the
end of 1858, it numbered forty members, all of whom resided in the city<i> </i>of
New York. It had a great struggle for existence, but ultimately succeeded beyond
the most sanguine hopes of its projectors. In five years it put forth its
branches from the Atlantic to the Pacific. Stretching northward, it had crossed
the St. Lawrence and the great lakes, spreading widely over the British
provinces. Toward the south it had reached the mouth of the Mississippi, before
the great rebellion cut off communication with the southern circles. Up to 1863,
the Fenian Brotherhood was little understood outside of the circles composing
it. Its representatives had never been summoned together to adopt such a
constitution and rules for general government, as a</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">association of its extent might have warranted. <b>It </b>had
more the nature of a military organization than a civil and self governing body;
and while this suited its infancy, many disadvantages became apparent when it
had grown in numbers, intelligence and power. These disadvantages suggested to
the plead Centre, that the organization should be reconstituted on the model of
tho institutions of the Republic, governing itself on the elective principle. It
was then decided to call a National Congress.</p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Other matters pertaining to the welfare of the Brotherhood
demanded the consideration of its assembled wisdom. Thousands of the most ardent
and best working members had rushed to the defense of the Union. Many whole
circles had entered the army in a body, like the flourishing one at Milford,
Mass., under its gallant centre, Col. Robert Peard. No less than fifty branches
bad become extinct or dormant, and the rest had lost considerably in ardor and
efficiency, through the absence of their choicest spirits in the field. In the
West, the Brotherhood had sustained an almost irreparable loss in the death of
the Rev. Edward O'Flaherty, the devoted pastor of Crawfordsville. His death
seemed to paralyze Indiana, which, during his life, was the &quot;banner
state&quot; of Fenianism The revolutionary Brotherhood in Ireland demanded aid
and sympathy ; so the call for the first National Congress was issued.</p>

constituency of fifteen thousand men, half of whom at least were in the armies

O'Mahony, in the opening session, &quot;to lead us to battle for Ireland, nor
veteran soldiers to follow them.&quot; The Congress met to place the
Organization on a basis in accordance with the habits and customs of the United

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">is no idle boast to say that the English Government has been
influenced in no small degree by the actions of the Fenians here and at home, in
abstaining thus long from openly aiding in the dismemberment of our union. Thus,
perhaps fortunately for our cause, while working for the liberation of Ireland,
we are also serving the best interests of America.&quot;</p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Among the important subjects brought before the Second
Congress_ was a len<u>g</u>thy report by Mr. Philip Coyne, of Missouri, Central
Envoy to Ireland, of his examination and inspection of revolutionary affairs in
Ireland. He reported the masses of the people as desirous for revolution, Mid
that the middle class, though hesitating to pass into a career of trial and
labor, would in the extremity of a revolutionary outbreak, act boldly with the
patriots. The national journal, <i>The Irish People, </i>was recommended for
sustainment, for the courage and ability it displayed; and the mode of
organization of the I. R. B. was declared to be as nearly perfect as possible,
being so arranged as to defy the strongest power or finest subtlety to penetrate
it.</p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">On the recommendation of the Head Centre, the Constitution
was mended so that the Central Council was enlarged to ten members, with a
President chosen by and front themselves. He was to act on occasions for the

<font SIZE="2">
<p>&nbsp;</p>
</font><b>
<p>62 FENIAN HEROES AND MARTYRS.</p>
</b>
<p>were materially extended. O'Mahony was unanimously re-elected.</p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Meanwhile so great a flame could not exist in America without
some smoke becoming visible in Ireland. The newspaper reports of the progress of
Fenianism in America were regarded as astounding developments, and being
reprinted in England and Ireland, excited the anxiety, and enlisted all the
resources of the Irish Government to watch and explode the counterpart
Revolutionary Brotherhood, on that side of the Atlantic. But the Irish
Brotherhood was manipulated with exceeding skill and foresight, and baffled the
keenest scent of the authorities, while it spread widely among the people. James
Stephens, one of the youthful participators in the '48 rising, had undertaken
the organization of Ireland. Certain envoys having been sent to Ireland, from
New York, for the purpose of seeing upon what basis a new revolutionary
organization could be started in that country, carried letters from O'Mahony to
Stephens, who had returned from France. In the early part of 1858, one of these
envoys, Mr. Joseph Deniffe, returned to America with a written document from
Stephens, showing already a formidable basis for action, and engaging, if lie
were sustained with certain funds, to greatly increase the number by harvest
time. The Directory of '48 was appealed to in vain by</p>
<b>
<p ALIGN="CENTER">HISTORICAL INTRODUCTION. 63</p>
<p ALIGN="CENTER">&nbsp;</p>
</b>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Meagher; who, if Ire did not actively enter into the'
movement afterwards, would never wilfully binder any measure undertaken for
Irish liberty. The money, although not amounting to more than two thousand
dollars, was raised with difficulty. With the first installment of it, Deniffe
was sent back, also carrying with him a Commission for Stephens as Chief
Director, signed by Doheny, O'Mahony, and others.</p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Having enrolled some thirty-five thousand men, Stephens came
to America in the fall of I858, to report progress, and solicit more generous
subsidies than he had received from America. At a meeting of the friends of
Ireland at Tammany Hall, New York, the collection of a fund was inaugurated; and
at the request of Stephens, O'Mahony was created Head Centre. The arrest in
Ireland at this time of the members of the &quot; Phoenix Society,&quot; which
showed that some active disloyalty existed there, gave the cause here a much
needed impetus, and aided the purposes of Stephens' visit. Attention had been
directed to him on the Phoenix trials; and for a couple of years following,
during which time lie was in France, the revolutionary party did not seem to
make much progress in Ire land. This partly arose from the fact that remittances
from America were not of that character to keep it in working order. In
December, 1860, Mr. O'Mahony went to Ireland himself, to be personally satisfied</p>

</b>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">on the state of affairs. The most important districts were
inspected, and a meeting of certain leaders held in Dublin, at which definite
plans were laid down. Stephens returned to Ireland and O'Mahony to America, and
the organizations on both sides of the ocean progressed with powerfully
effective strides. That Stephens was successful to a degree without parallel in
Ireland for half a century, cannot be questioned. With special qualifications as
an organizer, he traveled throughout the island under various names and in many
disguises, making the personal acquaintance of the people, and was to them for
some years an object of wonder, almost of worship. That O'Mahony had also done
wonders in organizing the Brotherhood in America and Canada, was attested by the
thankful Congress of Chicago, which passed resolutions recording his wisdom,
genius, eminent purity and heroic virtues, during the five trying years through
which the organization had struggled.</p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The mystery which baffled the Government in Ireland, and the
might which the auxiliary Fenian Society of America, represented, combined to
bewilder and exasperate the authorities. At the close of the Civil War many
officers of the Irish Brigade, Irish Legion, and other Irish-American commands,
which had seen much service, found their way into Ireland. Of' these not a few
regarded their preservation in the</p>

<b>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;</p>
</b>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">great conflicts of the war, as a providential sign that they
were destined to lead their countrymen to victory on their native soil. Young
men were found drilling, books of drill-instruction were also discovered in
suspicious places, and a variety of incidents added to the growing excitement.
It was suddenly discovered that the Irish Government was sitting on a mine, that
not only Cork and Dublin, and Tipperary, were hot-beds of disloyalty, but that
disaffection was rife among the soldiery, and that the conspiracy had extensive
ramifications in Liverpool, Manchester, Glasgow, and other manufacturing
localities over the channel. A reward of £200 was offered for the capture of
Stephens, all the transatlantic, steamers were boarded and searched for
Irish-American-looking persons, and on the evening of the 15th of September,
1865, the <i>Irish People </i>was seized, and several arrests made, including
Thomas Clarke Luby, J. O'Donovan (Rossa), and John O'Leary, the chief conductors
of that journal. Numerous arrests in Dublin, Cork and other localities followed,
and a state of feeling, recalling the feverish days of '48, but on a much larger
scale, was visible throughout the island. Several soldiers were arrested, and
the Sergeant-Major of a regiment in Cork, acknowledged his signature to a Fenian
roll-book which had been captured. This suggested imminent insecurity, and
caused a run on the Cork banks.</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Bills of Exchange from the Fenian Treasury in New York to the
Irish leaders, amounting to no less than £3,000 were intercepted, and arrests
of many important local centres continued to be effected.</p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This intelligence awoke widely-extended sympathy in America ;
and after sitting for some days in New York, the Central Council of the Fenian
Brotherhood issued a call for a Congress to be held in Philadelphia, on the 16th
of October. The deliberations of this assembly were looked to with anxious
anticipation. It was very largely attended, and the enthusiasm which had already
existed was greatly intensified by the arrival on the 19th, direct from Ireland,
of Mr. P. J. Meehan, who had visited it as the accredited envoy of the
Brotherhood. His report, which exhibited the accomplishment of a magnificent
work, the organization as powerful, the management masterly, and the position
solid, was received with exciting demonstrations. The most important measure of
the Congress, however, was one changing the Constitution and officers, and
drawing not a little ridicule on the organization. The new Constitution created
a President, and Secretaries of the Treasury, Military, Naval and Civil Affairs,
a Senate, the President of which would be Vice-President of the Brotherhood, a
House of Delegates, and all the governmental paraphernalia, in name, of a
distinct republic, within the American Republic. Other</p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;</p>
<b>
<p ALIGN="CENTER">HISTORICAL INTRODUCTION. 67</p>
</b>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">important and depreciating changes were made ; and in a very
brief period thereafter the vital differences introduced into the Constitution
were augmented by differences between the &quot;President&quot; and the
&quot;Senate,&quot; which extending, created a disastrous dismemberment of the
body of the organization. In a personal way the differences bred distemper,
distemper vilification, vilification subterfuge, and subterfuge found
sustainment in dishonor, and culminated in hatred. The American public was
disgusted, the Irish cause disgraced by the charges and counter-charges which
the interested parties too readily rushed into print. The record of these
painful conflicts would occupy volumes: I feel humiliated to have to refer to
them in a paragraph. It is only necessary here to add that John O'Mahony had
been declared the unanimous choice of Senate and Delegates, for President, and
was elected ; and that the seceding party, among whom were twelve of the fifteen
newly-created Senators, chose William R. Roberts, President of the Senate, as
their Chief. The distinctive policy of the circles which followed the latter,
developed into an armed expedition into Canada, which was attractive to a large
class as offering more immediate excitement. Thus the powerful Fenian
organization of America, became divided into what will be known as The Irish
Party, and The Canadian Party. Under these exigences, the</p>

</b>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">former held a Fourth National Congress, in New<b> </b>York,
January 2, 1886. Over four hundred delegates, the largest representation of
Fenians that had ever met, assembled, from Australia, the Pacific shores,
British Columbia, Canada, and all portions of the United States. The old
Constitution was restored, the Senate abolished, the history of the differences
reviewed, an address issued, and O'Mahony reinvested with the old office of Head
Centre. The proceedings of this Congress were accepted by a Military Convention,
which assembled in New York, on the 22d of February, the anniversary of
Washington's birth-day, and issued a spirited address signed b<sub>y</sub>
eighty-five officers and forty sergeants, nearly every one of whom had seen
service.</p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In the meantime there was no diminution of the excitement in
Ireland; and if anything would have united the discordant elements in America, a
contemplation of the state of affairs there should have done it. The arrest of
Stephens in Ireland was a great triumph for the authorities ; but his defiant
course when brought before the magistrates, and his subsequent wonderful escape
from jail, soon turned the tables, and gave the victory to Fenianism and the
people. Notwithstanding that the Irish Attorney-General, at the close of the
Special Commission, which tried the Fenian prisoners, boasted that &quot; every

not otherwise stay.</p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The debate on this measure, -which took place on the 17th
February, was rather brilliant, and as it bears directly on the state of
Ireland, some facts elicited in it very fitly fall into a brief narrative of the
times. In proposing and advocating the bill, Sir George Grey, the Home
Secretary, traced the history of Fenianism, from his stand-point, up to the
close of the American War, when it took a more threatening aspect. In the papers
and proclamations captured, he saw that the desire of the Fenians was the
disruption of the connection with England. The capture and conviction of so many
of the leaders had not produced any good result.</p>

  treasonable articles, it has been seized by order of the Government, and any
  person found circulating it is subject, no doubt, to a prosecution; but if

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Secretary justified the suspension, on the demands made
by Lord Wodehouse, the Viceroy of Ireland, whose letters were full of most
significant testimony to the power of the Fenian Brotherhood. Writing on the
21st January, 1866, Lord Wodehouse says:</p>

    <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;I hope that the presence of troops in some of the
    towns may perhaps allay the general alarm. I am, however, by no means
    confident on this point, and I wish to call the serious attention of the
    Government to the state of affairs here, which I regret to say becomes daily
    more unsatisfactory. When the <i>People </i>was seized and the arrests made,
    the Fenians were for a while stunned by the blow, especially by the arrest
    of Stephens, but after Stephens' escape their spirits great revived, and
    their activity was renewed. At the present moment, notwithstanding the
    perfect success of the Crown at the trials, they are more active than ever.
    I waited patiently to see would the alarm in the country subside, but the
    alarm has gone on continually increasing. I am now disposed to try what
    effect can be produced by proclamations, and by detaching troops to the more
    remote districts. With this view, we are about to send troops to Tralee and
    Sligo, and to proclaim the counties of Sligo and Carlow, in accordance with
    the strongly expressed wishes of the magistrates. Other proclamations will

    <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">come necessary hereafter. But I do not expect that these
    measures will be sufficient ; and in common with Mr. Fortescue and the
    Attorney-General, I have come to the conclusion that we may have to propose
    to the Cabinet to ask Parliament to suspend the <i>Habeas Corpus </i>Act.
    What we have to deal with is a secret revolutionary organization spread over
    a great part of the country, supported by money from the Irish in America
    and Great Britian. This organization has its paid agents in most of the
    towns in Ireland, diligently propagating rebellion and swearing in recruits.
    I send you a return of men who served in the American war, who are known to
    the Constabulary as Fenian agents. There are, no doubt, others who escape
    notice. I have asked for a similar return from the rest of Ireland. These
    are the men who would take command of the rebels, and there cannot be a more
    dangerous class. Besides them, we know that there are some hundreds of men
    in Dublin and elsewhere who have come over from England and Scotland, who
    receive regular pay, and are waiting for the signal of an outbreak. Now, we
    see no remedy for this but to suspend the <i>Habeas Corpus Act. </i>We
    should be able to arrest the paid agents of revolution, and to prevent the
    assemblage in the capital of men sent over specially to take part in a
    rising. The remedy may appear sharp, but the disease is very serious, and I
    am convinced will yield to nothing but sharp treatment. Without saying that
    the moment has actually arrived for so strong a measure as the suspension of
    the <i>Habeas Corpus </i>Act, I have thought it right to warn the Cabinet
    that, in my judgment, that moment is not far distant.&quot;</p>

thoroughly reckless, and possessed of considerable military experience, acquired
on a field of warfare, (the civil war in America,) admirably adapted to train
them for conducting an insurrection here. There are 340 such men known to the
police in the provinces, and those known in Dublin amount to about 160, so that
in round numbers there are 500-of course there are many more who escape notice.
This number is being augmented by fresh men constantly arriving from America. In
Dublin itself there are several hundred men (perhaps about 300 or 400) who have

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr, John Bright would not oppose the bill, but threw the
responsibility of its necessity on the evil and unwise legislation of England
for Ireland. He did not believe the Secretary overstated the case. On the
contrary, he believed that if the majority of the people of Ireland had their
will, and could do it, they would remove their island two thousand miles west of
England ; that they would, if they could, by conspiracy, insurrection, or
constitutional agitation, shake off English domination to-morrow.</p>

  Crown ought ever to have uttered, with regard to that country. (Cheers.) Twice
  in my Parliamentary life these things have been done-at least by the close of
  this day they will have been done-that measures of repression, measures of
  suspension of the civil rights of the people, have been brought into
  Parliament, and passed with extreme and unusual rapidity. * * * If I go back
  to the Ministers who have sat on these benches since I have been in the
  House-Sir Robert Peel first, then Lord John Russell, then Lord Derby, then
  Lord Aberdeen, then Lord Palmerston, then Lord Derby again, and now Earl
  Russell-they did not all sit here, and I speak, of course, of their
  governments, I say with regard to all these men, the dead and the living,
  there has not been an approach to anything that history will describe as
  statesmanship in this matter. (Hear, hear.) Coercion Bills in abundance, Arms

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">disaffection in Ireland was sent from the United States, Mr.
Bright could take no consolation from it. It only added difficulty and gravity
to the question ; for if the Irish have settled in America with so strong an
hostility to England, &quot;they have had their reasons;&quot; and if, with the
feeling of affection for their native country, which in all other cases they
&quot;admired and reverenced,&quot; the American Irish stirred up the sedition
which existed, &quot;depend upon it there is in the condition of Ireland a state
of things which greatly favors their attempts.&quot; After rating the ministers
for lack of statesmanship, in fighting for office, and not considering either
their duty to the people or the sovereign, he said<br>
</p>
<blockquote>
  <font SIZE="2">
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot; It is not in human nature-all history teaches
  this-that men should be content under a system of legislation and of
  institutions such as exists in Ireland. You may pass this Bill-you may put the
  Home Secretary's 500 men in gaol, you may suppress conspiracy and put down
  insurrection, but the moment they are suppressed there will still remain the
  germs of the malady, and from those germs will grow up, as heretofore, another
  crop of disaffection, another harvest of misfortunes. (Hear, hear.) And those
  members of this House-younger it may be than I am-who may be here 18 years
  hence, may find another Ministry and another Secretary of State proposing to
  them another administration of the same ever-failing and poisonous

grievances to complain of.&quot; Mr. Horsman thought Bright's speech
&quot;valuable only to the Fenian conspiracy.&quot; Mr. Stuart Mill did not
blame her Majesty's ministers for the present state of affairs, as they could
not be responsible &quot;for the misdeeds and neglect of centuries,&quot; but he
agreed with Bright that the Bill was cause of shame and humiliation to England.
The question then fell into the hands of the Irish members. Mr. John B. Dillon
thought that Fenianism was exaggerated, because he was a<sup>b</sup>le to defeat
its influence at the last general election, but he perfectly well knew on the
other hand that whatever power the organization possessed, was derived from the
general dissatisfaction of the Irish people, arising out of years of
misgovernment. This conviction justified him in opposing the measure introduced
by the Government. He briefly replied to Roebuck's sneer that Ireland had no
grievance. They excused the necessity of doing justice to Ireland by publishing
for years that she was in profound repose and contentment : and when she is not
contented, but seditious, they also use <i>that </i>as a reason to withhold
beneficial legislation. Dillon, for one, could not aid them in any effort to
quell that discontent which, he believed, was caused by a denial of justice. In
his opinion, discontent and disaffection were not unmixed evils, as he believed
that</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">but for discontent in England, there would have been no
Reform Bill, and unless Mr. Bright had exerted himself to excite discontent the
probability was that we should still have been suffering under the burden of the
corn laws.</p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">A Mr. Conolly, believed Ireland was galvanized into rebellion
by America, and also that concessions would not lessen the prevailing
insubordination. Sir John Gray regarded Bright's speech as calculated to do
mischief. He did not want to hear Fenian speeches in the House; and declared the
purposes of the Fenians to be the taking of life and property. The O'Donoghue,
though not a Fenian, came to their defence and covered Gray with confusion.</p>

  the motives of the organizers of the movement. He attached no weight to that
  allegation, because he knew that similar charges had been made against all
  those who at any time had endeavored to bring about a national movement in
  Ireland. They were made against O'Connell (hear, hear, from Mr. Bright), and
  they were made-if he might be allowed to say so-against the hon. member for
  Kilkenny (Sir J. Gray), when he was a distinguished inmate of Richmond
  Bridewell. (Much laughter.) Statements of that kind were no doubt useful in
  throwing discredit on the movement, but he maintained that when those
  statements were without foundation it<b> </b>was discreditable to use
  them.&quot; (Hear, hear.)</p>

These came, he said, &quot;from the representatives or deluders of the small
Orange party of Ulster, who looked upon it that the greatest blessing the
Government could bestow on Ireland would be to suspend the Constitution, not for
six months, but for ever.&quot; Out of a House of three hundred and seventy
members, but six voted against leave to bring in the Bill. Hence it was brought
in and put through all its stages within twelve hours. With similar speed it
went through the Lords the same day ; the Earl of Derby taking occasion to say
he could not admit &quot;that the Fenian conspiracy was entirely due to the
closing of the American war, because he knew that in 1859, the Phoenix
conspiracy prevailed in Ireland, and had numerous branches in America.&quot; The
celerity of English legislation, in this instance, in bringing aid to the
English interest in Ireland was almost without parallel.*</p>

of Irish prosperity when there is dearth, of contentment when there is
discontent, of improvement when there is impoverishment, is a very old
subterfuge. Swift strove to combat it. In his day the courtier who wished to be
successful, kept the Irish question out of sight, by misrepresenting the state
of the country, and alleging it was &quot; in a flourishing condition, the rent
and purchase of land every day increasing.&quot; &quot;If,&quot; says Swift, in

sought-for scope to the English authorities in Ireland. Arrests were made on
every side, and prisoners were counted by hundreds. The secret movements of
Stephens were continuous sources of excitability, and a Fenian riot in Bradford,
Yorkshire, at which the Irish Republic was cheered, and the police severely
handled, was not calculated to raise public confidence.</p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In America, the news begat renewed activity all over the
country. Mass meetings in the open air and in the principal public halls were
held in New York,</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Washington, Philadelphia, Brooklyn, Boston, Baltimore,
Savannah, Mobile, and many other cities and towns, and a general clamor for
action came from all points to the headquarters in New York. The Irish party and
the Canadian party still continued to widen the breach between them, and while
the latter was preparing to move on Canada, the former made a futile attempt to
occupy Campo Bello as a military depot. Soon after this event Mr. Stephens
arrived in New York amid great <i>eclat, </i>and O'Mahony withdrew to give his
coadjutor a chance to adjust differences. It was thought that Mr. Roberts would
yield the control of the Canadian party, as O'Mahony had retired from that of
the Irish party, and thus open the way for a union of both under the lead of
Stephens. This hope, however, was without foundation; and the former making a
move on Canada, and engaging the Canadian troops at Ridgeway, attracted
universal attention. Thus becoming the &quot;party of action&quot; for the
moment, the Canadian party greatly distracted the Fenian element, and
effectually interfered with Stephens' purpose in America.</p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">To counteract the effect of the raid across the St. Lawrence,
as well as to keep pace with a demand for action which he had cultivated in the
public mind, Stephens made promises, which he was not able to perform. He

himself by another promise. lie deemed this politic, and had the example of
perhaps the greatest modern politician, O'Connell, for such a course; but it is
to be hoped that the race which a quarter of a century age periodically cheered
the announcement that Repeal would be attained &quot;in six months&quot; is
extinct. The mission of Stephens to America was a failure ; he finally declined
moving in Ireland, and retired into privacy in Paris. His military friends
sought to force him to redeem his promises at any and every risk ; and failing
in this, took it upon themselves to make the attempt.</p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">On the faith of the promises of a rising, numbers of veteran
officers had gone to their different posts in Ireland and England, at the close
of 1866 and the beginning of 1867. These were now joined by the military staff
of the ex-chief, and the determination of these men to strike a blow was soon
illustrated. A Fenian demonstration at the English city of Chester, on the 11th
February, produced a tremendous panic in England; but the intentions of the
revolutionists were frustrated by Corydon, the informer, who was in the pay of
the English authorities from the September previous. Within a couple of days a
revolt took place in Kerry, under Colonel John J. O'Connor, and the locality
became the scene of great excitement, which</p>

speedily effected under one of the &quot;Indian heroes;&quot; but O'Connor, a
young veteran of the Irish Brigade, out-manoeuvred him, retreated with his band
to the mountains, and completely baffled the troops. On the 15th, the Government
stated to Parliament that &quot;Colonel Horsford's force was altogether too
small to follow the armed band of Fenians into Toomie's Wood.&quot;</p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The rising in Ireland was to have been simultaneous, but
discovering that the plan for the capture of Chester Castle, and the troops in
it, had been betrayed ; and concluding, of course, that the Government was
prepared at all points, the leaders sent messengers countermanding the revolt.
Owing to his remote position, the order failed to reach Colonel O'Connor in time
to prevent his action, which thus had the appearance of an isolated movement. In
a few days the &quot;outbreak at Killarney&quot; was declared &quot;at an
end&quot; by the Indian hero, who thought, probably, that <i>he </i>had ended it
: and in a week telegrams everywhere conveyed the blissful news, &quot;Ireland
is perfectly tranquil.&quot; While the telegraph was busy making news of
Ireland's tranquility, the authorities were pursuing another mode of achieving
that end, and of contradicting it at the same time. Every vessel arriving at an
Irish port was searched by men armed with cutlasses, and expert in</p>

on the barracks in Drogheda. The next was from Castle-Martyr, in Cork, distant
two hundred miles ; and these were rapidly followed up by armed displays and
conflicts with the Government forces in the counties of Dublin, Limerick, Down,
Clare, Wicklow, Waterford, Kildare, Kilkenny, Queen's County, and Tipperary. The
wildest rumors agitated society. Nothing was talked of but attacks on barracks,
conflicts with the military, midnight manoeuvres, railroads broken up, telegraph
wires torn down, Fenian arrests and &quot; Greek fire.&quot; Fenianism in the
army had created jealousies and bickerings, which found an occasional outlet in
the form of a riot : and some of the soldiers who fell in the open conflicts

being a &quot;serious fight&quot; which took place at Ballincollig Barracks,

extensive artillery depot and government powder-mills. The cause of the outbreak

  <i>Morning Post:</p>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;SIR,-A </i>reprint of a letter which appeared in your
  journal a few days ago, on the above subject, has just come under my notice,
  having been copied into a Dublin newspaper. In reply, I would beg your
  permission to make a few remarks through the medium of your aristocratic,
  though apparently impartial, journal. The writer of the letter in question
  seems to have read a one-sided, and ,consequently false, account of the rising
  of the Brotherhood in defence of their liberty, when he says: `Several of the
  interesting Fenian Brotherhood have been shot down in armed rebellion against
  their Sovereign. * * * I hope he (Lord <i>Strathnairn) </i>will shoot many
  more, and hang and flog the remainder.' Allow me to inform the writer that for
  every one of our Brotherhood shot, six men of the British soldiers have
  fallen. Many of these, I know, were shot by their own comrades in skirmish-not
  accidentally, but because of their perfidy towards the cause of freedom, and
  their avowed determination to show the Fenians `no quarter.' In a skirmish, in
  which I had temporary command, I saw no fewer than six of the 6th Carbineers
  unhorsed by one volley from our ranks, These were taken away in wagons, and
  nobody has since heard of them. I could cite many instances of a similar kind,
  if it were necessary. The fact is, sir, the British Government is most careful
  in keeping all these matters secret, for obvious reasons; but should you
  publish this letter, the Irish people, or at least such of them as belong to
  the I. R. <i>P</i><sub>.</sub><i> </i>y, or have made strict inquiries into
  the facts of the case, will fully corroborate my statements. I am, sir, your
  obedient servant, A SERGEANT-MAJOR OF THE 19th REGIMENT, IRISH REPUBLIC

pleasure.</p>

Godfrey Massey, a sort of adjutant-general to Colonel Thomas J. Kelly, who bad
direction of affairs in America after the retirement of Stephens. Massey was
arrested on the night of the 4th March, at Limerick junction, swooned, woke up
in the Castle, and under the influences of a vindictive, cowardly nature, and
his wife, betrayed the cause. The Government, in possession of sufficient
information to shorten the life of the insurrection, lost no time in putting
forth its every appliance for its suppression. The history of the Fenian revolt
of '67, cannot now be detailed; but the world has already acknowledged the
courage, dignity and devotion brought to its service by such heroic spirits as
Peter O'Neill Crowley, Thomas Francis Bourke, and their comrades-some dead, like
the former, and others, like the latter, reprieved from the scaffold to suffer a
living death in perpetual imprisonment.</p>

Brotherhood in America, if ever written, will disclose as noble labors and
sacrifices, made by men in so-called &quot;humble life,&quot; to keep the
organization in healthy existence, as ever refreshed the hopes of a struggling
people. Immediately after the rising in Kerry, a National Convention (the fifth)
was called, and assembled in New York on the 27th February. Affairs were in a
great state of disarrangement, consequent on the feelings produced by Mr.
Stephens' action. These were adjusted, Mr. Anthony A. Griffin was elected
Executive, and measures taken to carry out a beneficial plan of operations in
aid of Irish Freedom. These were at once inaugurated, and the cable intelligence
of the simultaneous risings of the 5th March already found the Directory at
work. On the 10th, an appeal was issued by the Executive imploring harmony among
all parties, in view of the fact that England was willing to spend millions of
money and sacrifice thousands of lives to subjugate or extirpate our race.</p>

<blockquote>
  <font SIZE="2">
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">GENTLEMEN: I have received this day your invitation to
  attend a mass meeting to aid the Irish Revolutionists, now battling for
  liberty, to be held at Union Square, on to-morrow evening, at halfpast seven
  o'clock.</p>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am aware that it is somewhat the custom of public men to
  approach the Fenian movement with a delicate regard for our neutrality
  obligations, and of the duties enjoined by the laws of nations. Apart from my
  sympathy for the cause of Ireland, I may be pardoned if I do not individually
  entertain any high estimate of Great Britain's claims on us to keep peace
  within her dominions. When we were struggling for national existence, and the
  cause of Republican Government was on its great, perhaps, final trial, England
  gave aid and comfort, the violation of every principle of neutrality, on the
  side which it believed would work the destruction of our free institutions.
  Her people gave sympathy, money, ships and men, and munitions of war, to be
  used against us.</p>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I do not counsel, nor will I countenance, any violation of
  the laws of our country ; but I do not stand alone in the community in feeling
  no very keen sense of our national obligation to England, and an indisposition
  to go out of my way to seek safeguards for her protection.</p>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">At all events, I feel no restraint in expressing, as an
  American citizen, my most ardent sympathy in the struggle which is now taking
  place in Ireland, and my hope in its ultimate success.</p>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In the earlier days of the Republic, our Government did not
  stand on ceremony in expressing its sentiments in behalf of struggling nations
  emerging into freedom. More than forty years ago, when Greece was battling
  against the domination of the Turk, President Monroe did not hesitate to make
  their cause a subject of a message to Congress, and to express the
  &quot;strong hope long entertained, founded on the heroic struggle of the
  Greeks, that they would succeed in the contest, and reassume their equal
  station among the nations of the earth;&quot; and later, the Congress of the
  United States</p>
  </font><b>
  <p ALIGN="CENTER">HISTORICAL INTRODUCTION. 91</p>
  </b><font SIZE="2">
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">did not hesitate to express its sympathy for the fallen
  fortunes of the Revolutionists of Hungary, and to tender an asylum in this
  country to Kossuth and his gallant followers.</p>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Should we hesitate to send words of cheer and
  encouragement, and more substantial aid to the men who are now fighting for
  the redemption of their native land, because the land is not Hungary, or
  Poland, or Greece, but Ireland, and the oppressor is not Austria, Russia or
  Turkey, but England?</p>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">To my mind, the ultimate success of the people of Ireland
  in establishing their rights is a certainty. It is impossible that a nation of
  men of courage and capacity, firmly united in the determination to be free,
  can long be held in the chains of servile subjection. Ire</p>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">land demands the restitution of its ancient right of
  self-government; that it shall no longer be under the yoke of a power alien in
  religion, in feeling, in interests; it demands freedom, equality, and the
  rights which belong to manhood.</p>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">If our Government proves anything, it proves that these
  demands are just and right, and our history certainly indicates the validity
  of revolution. But it should be borne in mind that revolutions which do not
  turn backward are successful revolutions. Unsuccessful revolutions rivet the
  chains of despotism, and give a longer day to the oppressor. I know not what
  may be the means of the men in Ireland, or whether this is the fitting
  opportunity to strike</p>
  <p>the blow. To give the onward word of command in such a crisis of destiny to
  a people, involves the gravest responsibility.</p>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Let us hope that they who are charged with the
  responsibility, have acted wisely and well, and unite in earnest prayer for an
  early, successful and happy solution of the troubles of a long-suffering
  people.</p>

  am, very respectfully,</p>

&quot;upon every section and clasp of our Irish-born fellow-citizens, to lay
aside all partisan strife and personal animosities at this momentous crisis of
their country's fate, and to unite together, and rally as one man to the support
of their brave countrymen, now battling for their National Independence.&quot;</p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Negotiations were undertaken to effect a union with the
leaders of the Canadian party at this time, but without success ; and the Irish
party bent itself with redoubled zeal and energy to attract public sympathy and
aid to the noble cause it represented. The subject of Irish liberty having been
brought to the attention of the United States Congress, the Chairman of the
Committee on Foreign Affairs of the House of Representatives, presented a
resolution on the 27th of March, which though not as bold and broad as the
services of the Irish, and the baseness of England to this republic during the
war would warrant, is nevertheless of historical import, as putting on record a
fact to which England will not lovingly refer. The resolution, moreover,
received sufficient opposition to more emphatically distinguish the remarkable
unanimity by which it was adopted. The interesting proceedings are thus
condensed</p>
<font SIZE="2">
<p>Mr. Banks -- I am instructed by the Committee on Foreign Affairs to report
the following resolution:</p>
</font><b>
<p ALIGN="CENTER">HISTORICAL INTRODUCTION 93</p>
</b><font SIZE="2"><i>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Resolved, That this </i>House extend its sympathy to the
people of Ireland and of Candid in all their just efforts to maintain the
independence of States, to elevate the people, and to extend and .perpetuate the
principles of liberty.</p>
<p>Mr. Banks. -- I yield to the gentleman from New York (Mr. Robinson).</p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr. Robinson. -- I do not intend at this time to make any
lengthy remarks, and yet I desire to make some observations rather than let this
resolution pass in silence. I presume I may say, without any disrespect to the
chairman of the committee, or to the other members of the committee, or without
referring to anything that may have occurred in the committee, that I should
have preferred a much more decided expression of sympathy than this. But such as
it is, I trust it will pass as the beginning of good things. Before this
Congress expires I hope to have the privilege of introducing a resolution not
only of sympathy, but acknowledging the belligerent rights and independence of
Ireland. I throw this out in no spirit of bravado. I believe the independence of
Ireland will come. I believe that the train of circumstances now in operation
will bring about that result.</p>
<p ALIGN="CENTER">&quot;Truth crushed to earth shall rise again.&quot;</p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Nor can England take any exception to our interfering in this
matter. She has no more business with Ireland than we have -- She has no right,
title or claim whatever in that country except that which had its origin in
fraud and force. She took possession of Ireland by force and fraud, and she has
made that country through seven centuries of oppression a howling wilderness.
She has inflicted wrongs upon that people which no other nation under the sun
has suffered from another. In conversation with the Chaplain of the House to-day
reference was made to the parable of the good Samaritan. Sir, I maintain that we
have the same authority to interfere that the good Samaritan had, when he saw a
stranger by the wayside, who had fallen among thieves, and lay beaten and
bruised. There is hardly a government in Europe that does not interfere with the
affairs of other countries. Emperors and kings are all the time making new maps
of Europe, and running new</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">boundaries of kingdoms and empires. I may be asked what are
Ireland's chances of success? Her chances for success are greater than any other
people ever had who have achieved their independence. They are all rebels in
Ireland. There is not to-day an honest Irishman upon the face of the earth who
is not a rebel against British rule in Ireland.</p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The sympathies of all the world are with Ireland, while
England has the sympathy of no human being except its office-holders and
garrisons. It is something to have the sympathy of mankind with you against your
oppressors. Now, we are told that Ireland cannot govern herself. That statement
is not true ; Ireland can govern herself. Irish intellect to-day governs the
world; Irish intellect is good enough to govern England. Even the poorer sort of
Irishmen, like the late Duke of Wellington, proves good enough for that
business. Irish intellect to-day is uppermost in all the transactions of
England. She rules in her Parliament ; she directs her press ; she commands her
armies ; she fights her battles. Why may she not do so herself? Ireland to-day
has more disciplined men than any nation in the world, men who have learned the
use of arms, who have smelled gunpowder ; they are all over the world, in every
clime, in every land. Irish valor has bloomed into glory upon every battle-field
of this and other countries. In these United States, upon this very floor, may
be found Irishmen of the second generation, whose deeds I need not recount, as
they are on everybody's lips, and are a part of the history of this country.
Look through the history of the late war, and see how many of the generals, and,
above all, of the private soldiers, were Irish by birth or blood.</p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">To-day Ireland can raise the strongest army the world ever
saw. Her sons have been disciplined in the British army, in the army of this
country, and of every country in the world. She has more men now scattered
throughout the world ready to come to her assistance than would, under equal
advantages, conquer twenty Englands if they stood in her way. I know the great
difficulty is in gaining the first success. But other countries have achieved
their independence without the strength that is behind this movement, and some
time, in God's own time, Ireland will be able to take that</p>
</font><b>
<p ALIGN="CENTER">HISTORICAL INTRODUCTION. 95</p>
</b><font SIZE="2">
<p>first step in her forward movement, and then there will be no holding her
back. The first step gained everything else is easy.</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>If there were no other reason for our interference in behalf of Ireland, we
  have it in the fact that to-day no American citizen is safe upon the soil of
  Great Britain or in Ireland. Instead of the name of an American citizen being,
  as it should be, a badge of honor, a guarantee of personal security, it is, in
  Great Britain today, treated with more indignity than that of the citizen or
  subject of any other country. Two or three days ago, I received the
  information from an American citizen, in Liverpool, that, without any evidence
  to justify even a suspicion that he was implicated in any crime against the
  Government of Great Britain, he was arrested and dragged to jail, where,
  without even the form of trial, he was stripped of his citizen's clothes,
  dressed in the garb of a convict, and set to work to scrub the floors of the
  prison. If this is the treatment received by American citizens from the
  present Government of Ireland, may we not be pardoned for sympathizing with a
  movement which promises better treatment to our citizens under better rulers.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Mr. Banks. -- Mr. Speaker, I now yield to the gentleman from Missouri (Mr.
Pile) three minutes.</p>
<p>Mr. Pile here offered some verbal changes.</p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr. Banks. -- Mr. Speaker, it is the principle of monarchical
governments that once being States their continued existence as such must be
recognized. That is the universal principle on which such governments are
administered. We claim the same for republican governments. Ireland had once a
government of her own. That government has been displaced by the English
Government. If they are contending against the English rule, they are contending
to maintain the principle of the independence of States, and thereby I cannot
accept the modification proposed by the gentleman.</p>
<p>Mr. Washburn, of Wisconsin. -- I move the following amendment:</p>
<i>
<p>Resolved further, </i>That in sympathizing with the people of Ireland, we
deem it proper to declare that the present Fenian movement must prove entirely
abortive in bringing relief to that country, and that any encouragement to that
movement by resolution,</p>
<p ALIGN="CENTER">&nbsp;</p>
</font><b>
<p ALIGN="CENTER">96 FENIAN HEROES AND MARTYRS.</p>
</b><font SIZE="2">
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">unaccompanied by force, can only result in involving the
brave, enthusiastic, and patriotic Irishmen in difficulties from which their
brethren are powerless to extricate them.</p>
<p>Mr. Banks.-I hope that amendment will not be adopted. I demand the previous
question.</p>
<p>The previous question was seconded, and the main question ordered.</p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr. Banks.-I am entitled to an hour to close the debate. In
reference to the amendment, I have only to say this : it was considered in
committee, and it was not deemed advisable to present it to the House.</p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr. Wood. -- Mr. Speaker, the amendment is virtually a
nullification of the resolution itself. The country well knows as the House
knows that the present agitation in Ireland looks to the establishment of free
government in that island, as the result of this same Fenian movement. We all
know it is this Fenian movement that has effected military organization in
Ireland, and that every rebel in arms in Ireland, and all the preparatory
arrangements looking to the establishment of an independent government in
Ireland, have been promoted, if not originally prompted, by this Fenian
movement. It may be true that it will cost lives, aye of hundreds and thousands
of men in the prosecution of the Fenian movement. All revolutions cost blood
before they become successful. In our own revolutionary war oceans of blood were
spilled before we were able to establish our independence of the mother country.
Therefore, when we say by this resolution we sympathize with the people of
Ireland, in their present struggle, we say well and properly, but when we
succeed it by saying that we are against the Fenian movement, we nullify the
resolution reported from the Committee on Foreign Affairs. I call for the yeas
and nays on the amendment.</p>
<p>Mr. Eldridge -- I ask the gentleman to yield to me for a moment ?</p>
<p>Mr Banks. -- Certainly, sir.</p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr. Eldridge. -- I hope the amendment submitted to the

I look upon it, as does the gentlemen from New York,</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">as an evasion or nullification of the original resolution. It
seems to me that it is idle for us to express sympathy with the cause of Ireland
and at the same time deprecate every measure which the people of Ireland take
for their alleviation. It is worse than mockery to tell them in their
degradation and suffering that we sympathize with them, and yet advise against
every effort they make to throw off the oppression which weighs upon them. It is
not for me to determine at the outset that the effort they are making through
the Fenian organization may not result to their good. Ireland's nationally is a
cause worthy of Irishmen. What shall be done to achieve it is for them to judge,
Submission and inaction will certainly not save them. It may seem a desperate
struggle, but who can say that the liberties of that brave and generous people
are not worth all their efforts? Who of us can determine what may or may not be
accomplished? If their cause be just, and our sympathies with them, in the name
of God, in the name of liberty, let us not disparage any effort or discourage
any enterprise which to them may betoken success. Any blow which the oppressed
may aim at the oppressor to regain his rights and liberty has my heart's best
prayer for its success.</p>

<p>So the amendment was rejected.</p>
<p>The question recurred on agreeing to the resolution, and it was adopted.</p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As these pages are going through the press some documents of
peculiar interest reach us ; one is a debate in the House of Commons on the
state of Ireland ; another is a speech made by John Bright, in Birmingham, and a
third is the Queen's speech, read by commission, on the proroguing of the
imperial Parliament on the 21st of August. Every one read the Queen's speech
which came by cable. Very<i> </i>few read the other documents which came by
mail. As the two latter very flatly and authoritatively contradict the former,
and moreover, throw great illumination on the speech from the throne, I shall
have to place them in juxtaposition for the benefit of American readers
especially for Americans who are in the dark on the subject of Ireland, and who
chiefly seek to be enlightened from such sources as republications from the
&quot;leading English journal.&quot; In announcing that &quot;the treasonable
conspiracy in Ireland has proved futile,&quot; the Queen compliments the valor
of the troops, the activity of the police, and &quot; the general loyalty of the
people.&quot; The general loyalty of the Irish people is a sentiment of similar
import to the announcement s o constantly made that &quot; Ireland is
tranquil,&quot; or &quot;improving,&quot; or &quot;happy and contented.&quot;</p>

<p ALIGN="CENTER">of opinions and facts discussing the land, the educational,
and the church questions as relating to Ireland. None of the speeches were
intended to present a Fenian aspect, but all more or less were based upon the
facts of which Fenianism is the honest and fearless exponent. The best speech of
the occasion was made by Mr. Monsell, an Irish landlord and a loyalist ; but one
who, upon the word of Father Lavelle, is &quot; a deep thinker, a man of great
uniform action and princely fortune.&quot; His position adds immeasurably to the
force of his words, which, coming from any honest man, irrefutable as they are,
should meet the attention of every American thinker and publicist</p>
<font SIZE="2">
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;Never in the memory of any living man was there such
deep-rooted disaffection as there was now (hear, hear). Never were the minds of
the people so alienated from the Government under which they lived (hear, hear).
They were indifferent to the action of Parliament. Their eyes were turned not to
Westminster, but to Washington. That disaffection prevails among the lower
classes no one would deny, but it goes up much higher in the social scale. I do
not refer to actual Fenianism, but to that feeling of actual hostility to Great

that subject which satisfy me that this pervades the firming classes. It
pervades the vast majority of those who pay less than £100 a year rent. Many of
the younger members of the families of even larger farmers share it. The
shopkeepers in the smaller towns, and many of the smaller shopkeepers in large
towns, arc in ardent sympathy with it. What is the newspaper that is waited for
with the greatest interest? The <i>Irishman, </i>Which is full of unmitigated

placards in the streets of the large Irish towns advertising `Voices from the
Dock,' in other words, pamphlets containing speeches delivered by the Fenian
prisoners at their trials. Only the other clay, at Dungarvan, many of the
respectable people showed the direction of their sympathies, by providing
champagne and every delicacy of the season for some American Fenians arrested
there. At Waterford, not long ago, the mass of the people in one part of the
town hurried out at short notice, to rescue some Fenian prisoners who were
marching through the town (hear, hear). These were the sort of things which were
taking place every day in the South of Ireland, and which demanded the most
serious consideration of this house and of the Government. Has any cabinet ever
devoted to that consideration one-tenth part of the time it bestowed upon the
compound house-holder? Is any verification of the truth of my description asked

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Does not every Irishman who lands in America at once become a
Fenian? Does the voyage change his opinions? Is it not manifest that there he
only professes openly the political creed he may have concealed at home. Here,
then, is the result of six hundred years connection between England and
Ireland-military occupation--suspended liberties-universal discontent, and a new
Irish nation on the other side of the Atlantic, recast in the mould of
democracy, and watching for an opportunity to strike a blow at the very heart of
this empire. Now, let me ask what is the cause of this disastrous combination?
Is it destiny! Is it a wayward fate? Must we fold our hands in despair? Are we
powerless in this . emergency ? Is it impossible for two distinct races, such as
the English and the Irish, to be cordially united in feeling? Look at Alsace
(hear, hear, hear). There you have a population of German race-speaking the
German language, separated only by a river from the rest of the German race ;
and yet the inhabitants of Alsace are as thoroughly French in feeling as the
inhabitants of Touraine (hear, hear), and woe to the German who endeavored to
tamper with their allegiance. Well, then, if race is not the obstacle</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">to<b> </b>concord, is it religion? Look at Silesia -- in
1742, Silesia was taken from Austria and annexed to Prussia. From that day to
this, Catholic Silesia has expressed by word and deed nothing but thankfulness
for the transfer it underwent, and, as was shown in the war last year, no part
of the Prussian dominions contains a population more devoted to the house of
Hohenzollern than the Silesians are (hear, hear). Look again at Canada-look at
the Canadians of French origin. All history teaches the same lesson, justice and
equality have a binding force which nothing can destroy. But, sir, let me ask is
it not the most natural course to go to the Irish people themselves, and find
out from them what is the cause of their disaffection? (hear, hear). You will
find that they all will give the same reason. I am going to repeat that my
honorable friends who come from Ireland have heard <i>usque ad nauseam. </i>The
people of Ireland say that they are not governed according to their own wishes
or feelings or requirements, but according to the wishes or prejudices of the
people of England (hear, hear). They say they have no effectual control over
their Government, which is controlled by England, and that measures admittedly
just and suited to Ireland, are abandoned because the Government of the day is
obliged to conform its measures, even those that regard Ireland alone, to the
views, often ignorant, and to the narrowest prejudices of the people of Great
Britain (cheers). I do not say whether this view is right or wrong; but I can
vouch for its being the opinion, nay the conviction, not only of the peasantry
but of the middle and farming classes in the greater part of Ireland (no, no). I
do not know who says ' No, no.' It must be some one not very well acquainted
with Ireland. I see now who it is. <b>It is </b>the right honorable gentleman
the Attorney-General for Ireland. The other day that learned gentleman said that
the people of Ireland were not at all discontented (hear, hear). No authority
can be attached to the opinion of a gentleman who made such a statement (hear,
hear). I think it quite unnecessary, therefore, to refute his present
contradiction (cheers). What the people of Ireland, then, ask, is to be governed
according to their own requirements, just as the English and Scotch are
according to the requirements of their respective countries (hear, hear). And
they point to the re-</p>

</font><font SIZE="2">
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">markable instances in confirmation of the view that Irish
interests are sacrificed to English opinion. They take the land question, an old
grievance; for more than two hundred years ago Sir John Davies said, `No care is
taken of the inferior people. Tenants at will, by reason of the uncertainty of
their estates, did utterly neglect to improve the land.' They say that
Parliament recognized this grievance twenty-two years ago-that it deliberately
admitted that the Irish law of landlord and tenant was not adapted to the wants
of that country (hear, hear), and <i>yet, </i>in spite of eloquent speeches and
the exertions of eminent statesmen, nothing had been done to redress the
grievance (cheers). Over forty bills have been introduced-not one that touches
the admitted grievance has been passed (hear, hear). They ask-not, I think,
unnaturally-would an English or a Scotch grievance have been so dealt with
(hear, hear) ? Next they turn to the question of the Irish Church (cheers). For
a longer period even than twenty-two years, ever since 1834, the most eminent
orators and statesmen have declared that no grievance like it exists or ever has
existed in the world (hear, hear). Nowhere else, as Macaulay, Brougham, Lord
Grey, C. Buller, a whole <i>army of </i>distinguished men have proclaimed, are
the funds destined for the spiritual wants of a whole people appropriated to the
wants of a small minority (cheers) ? But eloquence, and reason, and authority,
and logic, have been powerless against prejudice -- orators and statesmen have
passed away, and the Irish Church remains. Would, the Irish people demands, such
an anomaly have been tolerated in England or in Scotland (cheers)? Do you
wonder, then, that the Irish people complain that they are governed according to
the feelings and prejudices of the people of England, rather than according to
their own requirements (cheers) ? Do you wonder that they resent the deprivation
of that which Guizot, in his last volume, declares to be the end of
representative government, viz: that a people should have a constant direction
and effectual control in their own government; that they should be ruled, not
according to the abstract principles of statesmen who do not know their
condition, but according to the peculiar wants generated by their own special
circumstances. If you mean to satisfy them, then, you must give them what they

Ireland, by a desire to make the Government hold out some inducement for those
not Fenians to become loyal. &quot;Make those,&quot; said he, imploring the
Ministers, &quot;that are <i>not </i>Fenians loyal, and you need not trouble
your heads about the Fenians.&quot; What an admission by an honest landlord who
does not advise coercion but concession ; not the rule of rage, but redress. The
Fenians are <i>dis</i>-loyal: Mr. Monsell says the mass of people not Fenians
are not loyal; <b>in </b>other words the vast majority of the people in Ireland,
Fenians or not Fenians, are opposed from their heart of hearts to the English

absorbing the whole ecclesiastical property of the whole kingdom. (Cries of

asked you if you were to endeavor to set up such an abomination north of the
Tweed, what would happen to Scotland? Tranquility? Constant union with England?
No; but exactly what you have in Ireland, only <i>fought out by </i>a people
infinitely more united than are the people of Ireland. And if anybody were to
attempt to set up in England what England has set up in Ireland, <i>England
would be in a condition of perpetual anarchy and constant revolt, </i>(hear,
hear).&quot;</p>
</font><font FACE="Bookman Old Style" SIZE="1">
<p>&nbsp;</p>
</font>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr. Bright's idea of a tranquil nation differs as much from
that in the Queen's speech, as their estimates of what makes a loyal man.
Moreover, the English Reform orator shows why there ought <i>not to be </i>tranquility
quite as forcibly as the Irish landlord shows there is none. American
journalists should note these facts and be prepared to expect a suspension of
the <i>Habeas Corpus </i>Act, as an echo to Irish &quot;tranquility;&quot; an
attack on a barracks to be hidden behind every official glorification of
&quot;content&quot; in &quot;poor Ireland,&quot; and to be morally certain that
the jails are overflowing when Ireland is complimented on her &quot;
loyalty.&quot;</p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">While the Queen's speech was being read, and the British
Parliament prorogued in London, on the 21st of August, the Sixth National
Congress of the Fenian Brotherhood was assembling in New York. Delegates
representing the States of Maine, Massachusetts, Connecticut, Rhode Island, New
Jersey, Pennsylvania,</p>

Manhattan, Long Island, and Counties and Towns of the State of New York, and
Canada, took their seats.</p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The administration of the affairs of the Brotherhood since
the last Congress was submitted and approved. The great object of the Assembly
was to consult on some means of reconstruction to meet the altered aspect of
circumstances in Ireland. To this end the Constitution was slightly amended, and
Mr. John Savage elected Chief Executive. On the next day, the 25th, Mr. Savage
attended the Congress. The following is from the official report:</p>
<font FACE="Bookman Old Style" SIZE="2">
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr. SAVAGE briefly addressed the Convention. After explaining
why he was unable to accept the invitation of the Convention, and be present at
its sittings (in consequence of severe illness which scarcely permitted his
presence for a brief period to-day), Mr. Savage thanked the Convention for the
high honor it had paid him in unanimously electing him to the office of Chief
Executive of the Fenian Brotherhood, and said</p>

persistently refused to allow my name to be brought forward in this connection.
As far back as the last Congress or Convention, I declined the proposition. If I
consulted my own desire, I would decline it now. My habits are at variance with
those of what is called an 'Irish politician,' a character with which I have no
desire to be confounded. My habits are those of a student and literary man ; and
I have been induced to accept this office on the urgent representation of good

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">based upon the same hope. They have been pleased to say that
possibly through me a union of discordant parties might be effected, and placed
the matter in such a light as compelled me to this course as a duty.&quot;</p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr. Savage spoke of the deep love of country which lay in the
centre of every Irishman's heart, and which needed only mutual respect among
themselves, and a proper incentive to be made an effective power. Without a
knowledge of details, the movements of the year were deemed failures. The world
judges causes by results-measures the character of attempts by their issues, but
time, to use a journalistic simile, was a careful proof-reader, a sedulous
emendator, and revised the erroneous impressions left by contemporaneous
judgments, often proving -what it will again prove-that failures are but the
openings to success.</p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr. Savage excused himself on account of the state of his
health, from speaking at length, but, in conclusion said he would invoke
Almighty God-the God of the sorrowful and oppressed, as well as the God of the
free, to illumine his brain with the fire of wisdom, and cleanse his heart with
the fire of truth, so that thus purified and strengthened, he might be gifted
with honesty, sagacity and courage, to unite the scattered elements of the race,
and fervently labor to guide them to a beneficial result.</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">SINCE the Fenian Brotherhood have become famous, a power on
the earth, and a terror to English ministers and excited Parliamentarians, there
have been many speculations as to the origin, meaning and appropriateness of the
designation -- Fenian. Some of these conjectures were very far-fetched, others
ridiculous, and none correct. That tracing the name of the Brotherhood to the
Phoenicians who calve to Ireland in the remote ages, was the only one
approaching rationality.</p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The era of the Fiann <i>(Feean), </i>that is the Fenian
period, was one the most romantic and glorious in the records of ancient
Ireland, and an account of the Fenian Brotherhood who then made it so, collated
from the most reliable authorities at hand, will doubtless be interesting in
itself, as well as furnishing the origin of the designation now so widely
recognized as synonymous with Irish liberty.*</p>

Eirionn </i>(the Fenians of Ireland), are mentioned in the Four Masters, under
the title of Fene, or Fein, which according to Doctor O'Conor, signifies the
Phoenicians of Ireland, and they were probably called so, says McDermott, from
the tradition that the Phoenicians came to Ireland in the early ages. Their mode
of life would seem to give some warrant to the conjec­ture that the name was as
likely to come from Fiadhach <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">(Feeagh), </i>a
hunt, and to mean an order of hunters. Thus the German Light Cavalry Corps,

<p class="MsoBodyTextIndent">The most widely accepted explanation of the name is
that 'the Fianna Eirionn, were called after Finn MacCumhal their great leader.
This Finn is the hero of MacPherson's Ossian, and is there called Fingal.

a long course of traditional renown in his country, where his name still lives,

as Pinkerton remarks, seems to have been in imitation of the Roman Legion. The
words of this critical writer are worth quoting here : ‘He seems, says he,
‘to have been a man of great talents for the age, and of celebrity in arms.
His formation of a regular standing army, trained to war, in which all the Irish
accounts agree, seems to have a rude imitation of the Roman Legion in Britain.
The idea, though sim­ple enough, shows prudence ; for such a force alone could
have coped with the Romans had they invaded Ireland. But this machine, which
surprised a rude age, and seems the basis of all Finn's fame, like some other
great schemes, only lived with its author, and expired soon after him.’ ”*
Finn, however, was not the founder, but the great disciplinarian and most re­nowned

meat was very particular ; when they had success in hunting, it was their custom
in the forenoon to send their attendants, with what they had killed, to a proper
place, where there was plenty of wood and water. There they kindled great fires,
into which they threw a number of large stones, where they remained until they
were red hot. Then they applied themselves to dig two great pits in the earth,
into one of which, upon the bottom, they used to lay some of these hot stones as
a pavement, upon which they would place the raw flesh, bound up hard in green
sedge or bull-rushes; over these bundles was fixed another layer of hot stones,
then a quantity of flesh, and this method was observed until the pit was full.
In this manner the meat was stewed till it was fit to eat, and then they
uncovered it; and, when the hole was emptied, they began their meal. This Irish
militia, it must be observed, never eat but once <b style="mso-bidi-font-weight:normal">in
</b>twenty-tour hours, and their meal-time was always <b style="mso-bidi-font-weight:normal">in
</b>the evening. When they had a mind to alter their diet, instead of. stewing
their meat, as described, they would roast it before these fires, and make it
palatable and wholesome.<o:p>

militia came to these fires to dress their meat, before they went to eat they
would strip themselves to their shirts, which they modestly tied about their
middles, and go into the other pit dug in the ground, which was very large and
filled with water. Here they would wash their heads and necks, and other parts
of their bodies, till they had cleansed themselves from the sweat and dust
occasioned by their hunting; and this custom was very wholesome and refreshing,
for they would rub their limbs and their joints, till they had forgot all their
fatigue, and became as sprightly and active as when they began their sport in
the morn­ing: when they were perfectly clean, they would put on their clothes,
and begin their meal.<o:p>

they had eaten they would apply themselves to build huts and tents, where they
made their beds, and designed to repose themselves for the following night.
These beds were composed and laid out with great exactness. They cut down
branches trees, which they placed next the ground; upon these was laid a
quantity of dry moss, and upon the top of all was strewed a bundle of green
rushes, which made a very commodious lodging. These beds, in the ancient
manuscripts, are called Tri cuilceadha na feine ; which, in English, signifies
the three beddings of the Fenians.<o:p>

numbers among its members very distinguished, as well as some very loyal
gentlemen; and it is not a little remarkable, that while they are sedulously
employed in disentombing from the dust of ages, the history, literature, bravery
and gallantry of the elder Fenian period; the Government are not less busily
employed in consigning to the death of dungeons, and the obscurity of penal
servitude, those who aspired to bring a new soul into Ireland, or revive the
spirit of the old national guard, in the creation of the Fenian Brotherhood. The
Ossianic Society ought to be encouraged in their efforts to illuminate the
Fenian history of Ireland. Macpherson, in his manufac­tured Ossian, leads us to
look upon Finn as a myth. The history brought to public view by the Ossianic So­ciety,
show him to have been what lie was, a great pa­triot-general, of remarkable
foresight, military genius, and heroism. There is no greater inspiration to
heroism than the example afforded by the deeds of heroes. In picture, poem and
story, they should be kept before the eye and heart of the people, to excite the
