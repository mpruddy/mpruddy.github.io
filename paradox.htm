		<p align="justify"><b>PARADOX Never Lost: (with apologies to John Milton) 
		There is no LEGAL INCONTROVERTIBLE proof that secession was forbidden by 
		the Constitution. The debate of Secession's legality is perpetuated with 
		the same arguments that have persisted since BEFORE Constitution was 
		ratified.<br><br>Upon the ratification of the Constitution, in regards secession, we are 
		faced with FAITH rather than LAW. The futility of the Constitutional 
		argument over secession brings to mind the similar futility: arguing the 
		what is meant by bible scripture. Catholicism and Protestantism, not to 
		mention agnosticism and a myriad of other religious orthodoxies, came 
		into being, all of whose advocates point to the bible as their 
		authority, proposing juxtaposed arguments and tenets of faith &quot;proving&quot; 
		the fundamental truth of their respective positions whereby a PARADOX is 
		thereby produced since not ALL these juxtaposed positions can be right.<br>
		<br>PARADOX LOST -- How to eliminate the Paradox: <br>The Constitutional argument for secession which presents a similar 
		PARADOX could have been, and still could be, resolved by a legislative 
		process that amends the Constitution and explicitly forbids, or allows, 
		secession. <br><br>What are the principal arguments in the secession debate?<br>
		<br>The fundamental argument FOR the legal right of secession is that any 
		power not given to the Federal government is retained by the state. The 
		POWER TO PREVENT SECESSION was not given by the Constitution to the 
		Federal government ergo the RIGHT TO SECESSION exists in the state. <br>
		<br>The fundamental argument FOR Permanent Union is that the ratification 
		process was not delegated to the individual state governments but rather 
		to &quot;THE PEOPLE&quot; of each state in the form of a Ratification Assembly and 
		that the Union is PERPETUAL by the fact that &quot;THE PEOPLE&quot; not the state 
		governments, created a PERPETUAL FEDERAL UNION and therefore no action 
		taken by a state to secede is legal.<br><br>The absence of any explicit definition of PERMANENT UNION, or any 
		explicit definition of THE RIGHT OF SECESSION in the Constitution and 
		the the fact no precedents had been set by previous adjudications on the 
		issue by the Supreme Court, allowed educated men of law to be able to 
		argue both viewpoints. No consensus that eliminated the PARADOX was 
		reached prior to the Civil War.<br><br>In an attempt to thwart the PERMANENT UNION argument, the Confederate 
		states called &quot;Secession Assemblies&quot; that were intended to REVERSE the 
		process of ratification. The Federal government, in its viewpoint, 
		having been permanently established at the moment the Constitution was 
		ratified by THE PEOPLE of the UNITED STATES, refused to recognize the 
		secession process. The PARADOX continued.....<br><br>The Constitution is ambiguous, an ambiguity that was known, and 
		intentional, by the men who drafted it --- this viewpoint and the 
		reasons for the ambiguity are covered in Stampp's research for his 
		article. Basically the Constitutional convention set up a process that 
		is familiar to our modern legislative process: if it is perfectly clear 
		what we, the people, are voting for, it might not pass -- or fail, 
		therefore, it is left ambiguous so our silver-throated leaders might 
		explain to us, the people, what we, the people, are voting for -- or 
		against, so both sides end up hearing what they want to hear and the 
		issue can then pass -- or not, leaving us with a PARADOX. Isn't 
		Democracy wonderful!<br><br>After secession votes were cast by the several states, also utilizing 
		this wonderful process, someone tamped a minie ball down the barrel of 
		his musket and we, the people, jumped for our weapons. That which the 
		Supreme Court and the elected leaders of the Congress of The[se] United 
		States couldn't resolve peacefully, the barrel of a gun was about to 
		accomplish militarily. <br><br>As far I know, since that war no amendment to the Constitution has been 
		passed to clarify explicitly that secession is illegal. Therefore that 
		PARADOX continues to exist.... <br><br>From time to time in my lifetime, California, Alaska, and other states 
		have threatened, perhaps not seriously, to secede and I am sure the men 
		who propose such secessions pointed to the Constitution for their proof, 
		as the men of the South did before them, and &quot;proved&quot; secession is legal 
		and, of course, the proponents of Perpetuity of Union pointed, as did 
		the North before them, to the same document and &quot;proved&quot; it would be 
		illegal. The PARADOX still exists.....<br><br>The Civil War like all wars proved at least one thing: You cannot secede 
		if you don't have the firepower and resources to make it stick. During 
		this awful process both sides continued the PARADOXICAL aspect of the 
		debate: the UNION claimed it was a War Against Rebellion and the 
		CONFEDERACY claimed it was a War Against Northern Aggression. <br><br>The PARADOX remained as the dead piled up in heaps on the battlefield. 
		Ordinary men, from North and South, who were not given a chance to vote 
		for -- or against, war and whose elected government was incapable of 
		resolving the secession PARADOX found that their respective elected 
		state governments did have the power to force them to fight out the 
		PARADOX on the field of battle. <br><br>Once again, an amendment to the Constitution could have unambiguously 
		specified that secession was legal, or illegal, and solved the problem. 
		And it still could do so if proposed and ratified....<br><br>Don't hold your breath for that amendment. The term Mugwump comes to 
		mine....<br>[During the 1884 campaign, they were often portrayed as &quot;fence-sitters,&quot; 
		with part of their body on the side of the Democrats and the other on 
		the side of the Republicans. (Their &quot;mug&quot; on one side of the fence, and 
		their &quot;wump&quot; on the other.)-Wikipedia]<br><br>And on this list (and many other Civil Warl 
		Lists) the PARADOXICAL debate spawns many posts......as<br>
