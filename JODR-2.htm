			James Stephens sowed the seed of his movement in Skibbereen in May, 
			'58, and before September there was a crop of sworn rebels in every 
			parish around that celebrated city. Nearly all the members of the 
			Phenix Society became members of the I. R. B. and took the oath. I 
			suppose, at this hour of day, I will not be charged with &quot;giving 
			away&quot; to the enemy any very important secret when I say that every 
			man took an oath renouncing allegiance to the Queen of Great Britain 
			and Ireland; swearing to take up arms at a moment's warning to fight 
			to make Ireland an independent democratic republic; to obey as a 
			soldier the commands of his superior officer; to be faithful and not 
			to betray any comrade or any trust connected with the organization. 
			After a year or two, when the organization spread extensively, the 
			first part of the oath was changed, and instead of renouncing 
			allegiance to the Queen of England the recruit swore &quot;allegiance to 
			the Irish republic now virtually established.&quot; The man who swore me 
			in got the chance of working himself up to a colonelcy if he could 
			enroll a regiment of men; he told me I could work myself into a 
			captaincy if I enrolled a company. The first man I swore in was 
			Patrick J. Downing, a first cousin of my own, he is now living in 
			Washington—Colonel P. J. Downing. He earned a colonelcy by working 
			in the Irish Revolutionary Brotherhood in Ireland, but corning to 
			America, after his release from prison in Ireland, he joined the 
			army here, was lieutenant colonel of John O'Mahony's regiment at the 
			camp in Elmira, in 1861; went through the war and came out of the 
			war colonel of the Forty-second Tammany Regiment. He was my first 
			recruit in Ireland, a full colonel in America many years, and here 
			am I a full private still. His brother Denis was sworn in in 
			Ireland; he came to America after his imprisonment in Ireland, went 
			into the war here, lost a leg at Gettysburg as captain in the 
			Ninety-ninth Regiment, was in command at Washington at the execution 
			of Mrs. Surratt, went to Ireland a few years afterward, and died 
			there. His brother Simon was sworn into the organization in Ireland, 
			came to America, joined a cavalry regiment, and was killed in the 
			war. The youngest brother, Dan, sworn in in Ireland, came to 
			America, too, joined the army here, and died a soldier. Here were 
			four brothers, all the boys that were in the family, sworn in an 
			early youth to fight for the freedom of their native land, coming to 
			America and fighting for freedom in their adopted land. I have known 
			many another Irishman that learned his first drill in Ireland in the 
			Fenian Brigade who drew his last breath in life on the battlefield 
			of America. So that whoever are down on the Fenians, Americans ought 
			not to be among them.</font></p>
			<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify"><font size="4">
			The several men I swore in worked with such energy that my command 
			very soon exceeded the number sufficient for a company command, and 
			I got promotion-I was told I could form a regiment. Mortimer 
			Moynahan worked energetically also, and his command likewise grew 
			into a colonelcy. There was another colonel or center in the 
			district—the man who swore me in—but as he lives in the old land, 
			and I have no liberty to give his name, I let him rest in peace. But 
			a good, bold, brave, daring man was he in his day.</font></p>
			<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify"><font size="4">
			We had the country in a ferment, and like as it was with us in the 
			South it was in every part of Ireland. James Stephens had bean 
			active. He had been traveling through all parts of Ireland, seldom 
			staying more than a day in one place, getting an introduction from a 
			good man in one town to a reliable man in the next town, sowing the 
			seed, laying down the law and taking his departure.</font></p>
			<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify"><font size="4">A 
			part of the law laid down to us was that when we had made fair 
			progress in the enrollment of men a military man would be sent to 
			give us instructions in drill, This instructor came to us in August, 
			and in old barns, in cellars, in the woods and on the mountains the 
			drilling of the men was carried on night after night. This 
			instructor remained a month, and when he left us the man who had 
			been most expert in learning the soldiers glorious trade was Patrick 
			Downing (Colonel Downing, now of Washington). He took military 
			charge of the district, and was out every night drilling the 
			recruits. It is a penal offense against England in Ireland to learn 
			drill or learn the use of arms, unless an Irishman is sworn into the 
			English service there, and when we were in the woods or on the hills 
			at night we had to have our videttes posted around us so as to give 
			warning of the approach of danger. We ware in Loriga wood one night, 
			an alarm was given that some people were approaching from a certain 
			direction. We ran away in the opposite direction. Jerrie Cullinane 
			leaped across a ditch at the other side of which was a big dyke. The 
			dyke was broad, and not getting clearly across it he fell. I leaped 
			after and fell upon him. Others leaped after me, and in a minute or 
			so some twenty or thirty of us were sprawling in the dyke. When we 
			regained our footing we learned it was a false alarm startled us—the 
			people who caused it were recruits who had not been to the 
			rendezvous up to time. This is one of the many incidents that used 
			to occur to make us laugh and be merry while we were breaking 
			English law learning how to fight for Ireland. As I am writing this 
			sketch of Fenianism in a free country, and as some free people may 
			read it, I will step a head of time a month or two and give one 
			illustration of my experience of how terror stricken English are at 
			an Irishman's learning anything about military matters in Ireland. 
			Some thirty of us were in Cork jail in December, '58. Denis Downing, 
			whom I spoke of as Captain Downing, who lost a leg at Gettysburg, 
			was one of the prisoners, the only criminatory act against him was 
			this: A policeman named Dove, swore an information against him that 
			he saw him marching through the streets of Skibbereen &quot;in military 
			order.&quot; McCarthy Downing, our attorney, cross examined the 
			policeman, sod when aching who was with Denis Downing &quot;marching in 
			military order,&quot; Dove said, &quot;No one was with him, he was marching by 
			himself, but he had a military step.&quot; McCarthy Downing laughed, the 
			prisoners laughed, and Davis, the Castle magistrate, and Sir Matthew 
			Barrington, the English Crown Prosecutor, looked dumbfounded. At the 
			further prosecution of these trials at the ensuing Tralee Assizes, 
			two coast guards named McCullagh and Cooper were put in the witness 
			chair to swear that with their spy glasses they saw men drilling on 
			the summit of Cnoc Ouma. This is a mountain on the southern coast of 
			Ireland—the same mountain on which Thomas Davis must have stood when 
			his eye took in that scenery on which he wrote : </font></p>
			<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; margin-left: .5in">
			<font size="4">The Summer's sun is falling soft on Carb'ry's 
			hundred isles.</font></p>
			<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; margin-left: .5in">
			<font size="4">The Summer's sun is gleaming still through 
			Gabriel's rough defiles;</font></p>
			<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; margin-left: .5in">
			<font size="4">Old Inisherkin's crumbled fane looks like a 
			moulting bird,</font></p>
			<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; margin-left: .5in">
			<font size="4">And in a calm and sleepy swell the ocean tide is 
			heard </font></p>
			<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify"><font size="4">
			In all Ireland, Killarney not excepted, there is not such an 
			entrancing view as can be had on the top of this mountain, environed 
			by sea, lake and river. Loughnie sleeps at its feet, with the ruins 
			of an old monastery crumbling on a little island in the center of 
			the lake; the river Ilen glides placidly by its side, with the old 
			castles of Old Court Baltimore and Inisherkin on its banks, and 
			Carberrys' hundred isles breaking the union of river and ocean, To 
			the top Cnoc Ouma the recruits of the Irish Revolutionary 
			Brotherhood repaired every Sunday to learn their drill, and from 
			their coast guard station at Baurlogue, near the Fastnett Rock, Hugh 
			McCullagh and Cooper spied at them with their telescopes and gave 
			telescopic information against them at the Assizes to convict them 
			of treason to Ireland and to Queen Victoria. In organizing the 
			country James Stephens told the men there would be aid from the 
			Irishmen of America. While we were to do all we could to arm 
			ourselves, we would not be called into the field of battle until 
			10,000 men at least were lauded from America, and until arms enough 
			were landed to arm the men of the organization. The assurance of aid 
			from America put great spirit into us at home; It helped us to 
			overcome many obstacles that were in the way of organization. 
			England and England's agents in Ireland were continually dinning 
			into the people's ears that it would be nothing but madness for an 
			unarmed people to think of rising against England—a nation that has 
			conquered the world almost, a nation that had as many ships of war 
			as could surround Ireland and burn every town and city on her coast,</font></p>
			<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify"><font size="4">
			All who were any way connected with the administration of English 
			law and government talked that way; all who were comfortably 
			situated and likely to become more comfortable followed suit. 
			Distressed and oppressed as Ireland was, there were many who had 
			business ties with the oppressor and who were prospering while the 
			masses of people were under decay. The same condition of things 
			exists in every country governed by another country. Our own people 
			themselves took up the sneer the English would give at the Irishman 
			who preserved his family traditions and would ridicule him for 
			saying that at such and such a time those lands, now in possession 
			of the Sassenagh landlords, belonged to his forefathers. Then there 
			were the moral force patriots, who would have land and freedom from 
			England without shedding a drop of blood, and without striking a 
			blow. Upward and onward, the new recruits of the Irish Revolutionary 
			Brotherhood had to fight their way against these. The toughest fight 
			and the biggest victory that came to me while organizing came to me 
			one night I was at a harvest home at Fivemile Cross, outside of 
			Newry. A farmer named Rice had gathered in all his crops, and all 
			neighbors around gathered at the house to enjoy the good things of 
			the table laid before them, John Nolan, of Carlon, now dead and 
			burled In Kansas City, was with me; we wanted to see a certain man 
			in the district, and the man was at the harvest home of Mrs. Rice. 
			So we cut across the field to Mrs. Rice's, met our men, and were 
			received as honored guests at the festive board. After supper the 
			glasses came on the table and punch and lemonade and mulled porter 
			were there in plenty. The chair was occupied by a very respectable 
			looking old gentleman named Convery. At his right hand side sat John 
			Nolan, at his left hand side was Mrs. Rico, the widowed mother of 
			the house, and I was seated next to her. Mr. Convery was a moral 
			force patriot, an out and out O'Connellite; he had been an active 
			man in the Repeal movement twenty years before that, and had also 
			been an active worker in the movement for Catholic emancipation. He 
			carried the whole country side with him, and whatever he said to the 
			people was law. In the course of conversation and speech making be 
			pretty strongly condemned Fenianism, and as John Nolan and I were 
			there specially to propagate Fenianism, we decided our mission would 
			be a failure unless we put a stop to the old gentleman's gallop. I 
			was introduced to the company as a Mr. Buckley, of America, who was 
			home to Ireland on a visit and tour of pleasure, and, of course, 
			could speak knowingly of the movements and aspirations of the Irish 
			people who were far away from home. Mr. Convery had all the talk and 
			seemed to be carrying the house with him. John Nolan was the only 
			obstructionist at the table. I was saying nothing. At last Mrs. Rice 
			asked me what I thought of the subject they were discussing, and I 
			had to speak. This was my speech: &quot;Mr. Chairman and Mrs. Rice and 
			friends, for though a stranger among you, I feel I am at home among 
			my Irish people and can call you all friends. I once had a home in 
			Ireland, but in the part of the country in which I lived there were 
			a class of people called landlords, and one day one of these 
			landlords came, bringing with him police and bailiffs, and forced 
			myself and my mother and sister and two brothers out of the house, 
			and then tore down the roof of it. That was in '47. We were all 
			young, except my mother. We had neither house nor home, as the 
			saying be. I don't know how she managed to provide for us, but 
			shortly some relief came from an aunt and two uncles' sons we had in 
			Philadelphia, who heard we were evicted, and after that, by degrees, 
			the whole of us got to America. I have not lived there without 
			knowing something of the feelings and the movements of our people, 
			many of whom have experiences and recollections of Ireland such as I 
			hare, and I know they feel fondly for all belonging to them in 
			Ireland, and feel very bitterly against landlord and English rule in 
			their native home. I know many of them are engaged in a movement to 
			free Ireland; I cannot claim the credit of belonging to that 
			movement, but I know enough to be able to tell you that the men of 
			every county are organized for work. Every county is to supply a 
			ship and furnish that ship with men and arms; those thirty-two ships 
			are to sail from different ports in America one particular day. The 
			County Down ship will make for Newry, or some other port in your 
			neighborhood here; the Antrim ship will face Belfast, the Derry men 
			will make for Derry; the Donegal men will make for Donegal, end so 
			on all round Ireland. It is calculated that all the fleet England 
			has—even if she could muster the whole of it around Ireland—could 
			not prevent some of those ships from landing men and arms.</font></p>
			<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify"><font size="4">I 
			don't know how you would all feel to-night if you heard there was 
			such a ship in Newry Bay, and that all the boys who had left the 
			neighborhood years ago were in it. Our good hostess hero at my right 
			was telling me a while ago that two of her sons, James and Pat, were 
			in America; Mrs. Rose McGinn, here at my left, was telling me that 
			two of her brothers were in America; our worthy chairman himself was 
			telling me that three of his brother's sons and four of his sister's 
			sons were in America; It strikes me if the news came to us just now 
			that the ship was below in the bay, that he would be as ready as any 
			of us to run down to welcome the boys back, and maybe as ready as 
			any of us to shoot down any one who would oppose their lending. I 
			thank you for the hearty applause with which you have greeted my few 
			remarks; and now I propose the health and the return to us again of 
			our friends who to-night are far away from home.&quot;</font></p>
			<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify"><font size="4">
			Mrs. Rice stood up and shook hands with me and kissed me. Mr. 
			Convery himself shook hands with me as the young men and young women 
			crowded around me. On our way walking into Kerry next morning John 
			Nolan would burst out into roars of laughter, thinking how we 
			carried the day. The country was safe; Mr. Convery was silenced, and 
			as we afterward learned Fenianism prospered in the district.</font></p>
			<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify"><font size="4">
			Some four or five mouths after the starting of the organization, the 
			English began to suspect there was something mysterious going; the 
			people were showing a more independent spirit and were not so 
			subservient to the will of the reigning powers. Some mishaps 
			occurred in the swearing in of men that brought the work under the 
			notice of the authorities. Patrick Mansfield Delaney and Martin 
			Hawe, of Kilkenny, were arrested and put to prison, charged with 
			attempting to administer oath to men, and Denis Riordan, of Macroom, 
			was arrested on a similar charge. While Mr. Delaney was in prison a 
			public demonstration of regard for him was made on his farm; his 
			crops were ripe, and the men and women of Kilkenny came in hundreds 
			one day and cut his wheat and oats, dug his potatoes, mowed his hay 
			and did everything necessary to the saving of his harvest. He was 
			released from prison some months after, the English could not get a 
			second man to swear against him. Martin Hawe and Denis Riordan were 
			also released. But their arrest and what transpired at their trials 
			in court made it evident to the public, that there was some kind of 
			a conspiracy on foot to get rid of English rule in Ireland. The 
			drillings that were going on at night in several parts of Ireland 
			also came to be spoken of, and by and by the newspapers began to 
			speak of &quot;the state of the country.&quot;</font></p>
			<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify"><font size="4">
			It is not so easy to write truthful story or truthful history as 
			many people think. I am already beginning to find it very hard to 
			write the story now—well, not hard, but painful, because I have to 
			write of things I would rather never had existence and of persons 
			who are dead, of whom I would rather have nothing unpleasant to say.</font></p>
			<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify"><font size="4">
			Mr. Alexander M. Sullivan, who died in Dublin last year, was editor 
			of the <i>Dublin Nation</i> in 1858; his native town was Bantry, a 
			place some dozen miles distant from where I lived. He had the 
			character there of being a good, trustworthy, patriotic Irishman, 
			and I believe he was all that while he lived there. In the '48 
			movement he and his family acted a patriotic part. The people of his 
			native town trusted him. Visiting Bantry in the Autumn of '58 he got 
			talking to James O'Shea and his brother William O'Shea and others 
			who had been enrolled in the organization. James is in New York 
			to-day. William occupied the same prison with me in Cork from 
			December, 1858, to August, 1858; he is the Captain William O'Shea, 
			of the Forty-second (Tammany) Regiment, who was killed in one of the 
			battles here during the war. When Mr. Sullivan was in Bantry it 
			seems he was told by some one that William Smith O'Brien was a sworn 
			member of the secret organization, and when he returned to Dublin he 
			wrote Mr. O'Brien asking him, was he? Mr. O'Brien replied to him 
			saying he was not, and he published the correspondence in the <i>
			Nation</i>. We were very angry with Mr. Sullivan for doing this, and 
			whether it brought trouble to us or not, it brought much trouble to 
			him after I published a letter in the <i>Dublin Irishman</i> 
			concerning it. I signed my name to the letter and he sued the <i>
			Irishman</i> for publishing it. When I was in Chatham Prison the <i>
			Irishman</i> republished the letter, and he again took the <i>
			Irishman</i> into the law courts for doing so. He argued that what 
			he did he did to correct misrepresentation and to save us who were 
			young and ardent Nationalists from the consequence of our youthful 
			folly. We argued that Ireland was like a house on fire with the 
			family locked in, and if we clambered to the top of the walls trying 
			to save the family and extinguish the flames, it was a poor way for 
			Mr. Sullivan to frighten us away from the risk and danger to fling 
			stones at us and throw us into the fire. His exposure in his 
			newspaper of the existence of a secret, oathbound, illegal society 
			was directing the attention of the Government&nbsp; to the prosecution of 
			the numbers of it ; he asserted&nbsp; that the Government knew of its 
			existence before he spoke; that a Kerry priest, Father John 
			O'Sullivan, of&nbsp; Kenmore, had given the information not with any bad 
			intention, but with a view to arrest the spread of&nbsp; what he 
			considered foolish work.</font></p>
			<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify"><font size="4">I 
			have some of the correspondence that passed between Father 
			O'Sullivan and Dublin Castle; it was in jail I came by it, and I'll 
			wait till I get into jail before I give it to the reader.</font></p>
			<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify"><font size="4">
			From what the <i>Nation</i> had, printed, from what Father&nbsp; 
			O'Sullivan had written, from what the &quot;informers&quot; to at Kilkenny and 
			Macroom had sworn and from general rumors of threatened rebellion, 
			the English authorities were pretty certain that a dangerous 
			movement was spreading, and they set to work to arrest it. They got 
			hold in Kerry of a man named Daniel Sullivan (Goula) and they put 
			him in training. A stipendiary magistrate named Fitzmaurice who had 
			long experience among the Orange and Ribbon societies in the North 
			of Ireland, was transferred from Belfast to Skibbereen and Sullivan 
			Goula was put in communication with him. Goula visited Skibbereen in 
			November, '58, under suspicious circumstances; the Kenmare wrote to 
			us saying he was bad and to beware of him, that no one would trust 
			him in his own district, but that he was sworn in in Bantry by a man 
			who did not know tile true character. We had an eye on Goala, but he 
			drew into his net every one who was watching him, every one who got 
			acquainted&nbsp; with him. He was in my shop one day, and going out I 
			followed him through the town at such a long distance as that I 
			could just barely keep him in view. I saw him suddenly turn back 
			anti walk toward me. I walked on, passed him by and had not gone far 
			when</font></p>
			<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify"><font size="4">I 
			met Fitzmaurice, the Stipendiary magistrate. Goula had seen him, and 
			that is why he made the sudden turn back in the street. I reported 
			what I saw to Morty Moynahan and a few others. It was Morty had 
			communication with the Kerry men. Goula had laid the groundwork of 
			having an excuse for visiting Skibbereen by writing a letter to 
			Morty's employer, McCarthy Downing, prior to the visit ; he applied 
			to have his brother taken into the law office as apprentice clerk, 
			and said he would come to town in a few days with letters of 
			recommendation. He came and put up to lodge at the home of a Kerry 
			man, Mortimer Downing, from whom he rented the rooms of the Phenix 
			Society. We told our men in town who Goula was and what he was 
			suspected of, and it was agreed upon by I some thirty of them that 
			they would go to the room on a certain evening and satisfy their 
			curiosity of taking a look at him and hearing him talk. They 
			satisfied their curiosity, but it came to be at the expense of their 
			personal liberty for a time, because Goula swore every one of them 
			into prison; be swore they were all, drilling that night at the Ken 
			Bridge, a mile outside&nbsp; the town, and that O'Donovan Rossa was the 
			drill master. The whole swearing was a lie. I never drilled any men; 
			he never saw any drilling; but he swore against the whole of us so 
			that none of us would be able to contradict what he swore. The sly 
			boy Fitzmaurice put up that job for him, and he played his part at 
			it according to instructions. When I found myself kept nine months 
			in jail on such a conspiracy as that, I felt that I had a personal 
			grievance to feed the strength of what I felt on the question of the 
			National grievances. I have many personal grievances of a like 
			nature since then, and I have experiences too to confirm the opinion 
			then formed, that when an Englishman governing Ireland suspects an 
			Irishman of doing something that is quite natural for him to do in 
			opposition to English law and rule, he has no scruple of conscience 
			in employing a vagabond of some kind to swear he saw the thing done. 
			Fitzmaurice was satisfied the drilling was going on in the district, 
			but he could get no one who saw it to swear against us; he made it 
			easy with his conscience and duty then to get a man who never saw it 
			to swear he saw it.</font></p>
			<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify"><font size="4">
			The fidelity of the Irish people in anything connected with 
			hostility to English law in Ireland is something strangers can 
			wonder at. A man who is banned or outlawed on account of his 
			breaking English law in connection with England's government of 
			Ireland, or in connection with England's levying of taxes in 
			Ireland, is looked upon as a sacred character, and entitled to the 
			protection of every patriotic Irishman. Ireland is governed by 
			force; the Irishman who resists that force, and who falls by 
			resisting it, may be foolish for himself, but he is always the idol 
			of the people—even of the most fallen of them. I knew poor men who 
			were working for twenty cents a day, to be offered hundreds of 
			pounds to come forward to swear they saw us going to the woods or to 
			the mountains where it was said the drilling was going on, and they 
			would not take the bribe. I knew an unfortunate fallen woman—Kit 
			Cadogan — to be offered money to swear she saw us going through the 
			woods at night; she did see us often, and as she would hear us 
			passing by we would hear her whisper through the trees &quot;Buadh De 
			libh a Chuachalaidhe—May God be victoriously with ye, boys.&quot; One of 
			the attorneys who was engaged by the English to assist in the 
			prosecution of us that time, has his office today in the same 
			building in which I have my office in the City of Now York, and he 
			can bear testimony that the poor &quot;unfortunates,&quot; as they are 
			called—the poor, fallen women of the town—refused to take the bribe 
			that would have made them comparatively wealthy.</font></p>

			Put an Irishman on the spit and you'll got another to turn him,&quot; is 
			a saying very much in fashion with the people who are enemies of 
			Irish nationality. They wish to propagate the belief that Irishmen 
			cannot trust one another, but will betray each other at every 
			opportunity. It is England's interest to have that impression very 
			indelibly impressed upon the action of the Irish people in their 
			politics, because while they will not trust one another, while they 
			will not have secrets which are dangerous to betray, there is no 
			danger to English rule in Ireland. The English law is fashioned to 
			meet and conquer every kind of public agitation, and if anything new 
			or dangerous arises in the agitation, the English Parliament is 
			ready at hand to forge new laws for the emergency. O'Connell's 
			agitation was a public one and a powerful one, so far as numbers was 
			concerned, but when the English thought it had gone far enough, they 
			issued a proclamation to put a stop to a public meeting O'Connell 
			had called at Clontarf and the meeting was not held. O'Connell was 
			subsequently put in prison, and after his release the movement 
			collapsed. The Land League agitation, led by Mr. Parnell, was a 
			powerful one, so far as moral force had power in it, but when the 
			English thought it had gone far enough they imprisoned it, and all 
			of us know the result. The silent work—the work England knows little 
			or nothing about—is what alarms her. She knows it is the most 
			dangerous to her Government, and against it she prepares all the 
			pains and penalties that can be devised. She encourages agitation so 
			long as she is sure there is nothing else behind it. I have seen the 
			time when she celebrated the national holiday of Ireland with all 
			the parade, pomp and glory that it could be celebrated by a free and 
			independent Ireland. I have seen a Patrick's day celebration at 
			Dublin Castle. The military bands played &quot;The Wearing of the Green,&quot; 
			&quot;Patrick's Day&quot; and &quot;Gerryowen na Gloria;&quot; the Lord Lieutenant and 
			the Lady Lieutenant, the Lord's gentlemen and the Lady's ladies were 
			on the balconies of the Castle palace bedecked with shamrock; one 
			lady's maid had a lap dog in her arms, and around the lap dog's neck 
			was a beautiful wreath of shamrocks; the people cheered and cheered 
			again; one man, Pagan O'Leary, who witnessed that display, came into 
			a room where I was sitting an hour after; there wore pots of 
			shamrocks on the window sills ; he raised up the windows and threw 
			the pots into the yard below. &quot;If the national emblem of Ireland,&quot; 
			said he, &quot;is to be worn by an English dog, this is no place for it.&quot; 
			The same Pagan O'Leary is at present in a Soldiers' Home in Western 
			Virginia; he had fought as an American soldier in the Mexican War.</font></p>

			Those words belong to one of Thomas Moore's songs; and the Irishmen

			And It never can be got rid of unless the people have trust in one 
			another. This trust in one another is what England endeavors to 
			kill; this is why she has nursed on the lips of the people that 
			expression: &quot;Put one Irishman on the spit and you'll get another to 
			turn him.&quot; There is nothing more false said of Irishmen, or by 
			Irishmen, and I know many of them say it. One of the best friends I 
			had in Ireland asked me to take a walk with him one day, as he had 
			something private to say to me. I went with him; I had lived in his 
			family from boyhood to manhood, from the time I was evicted by the 
			landlord and thrown on the world in 1847 till I got married; he was 
			Mortimer Downing, the father of the four men I spoke of in the last 
			chapter as having fought in the late war here. &quot;I have been asked by 
			your aunt,&quot; said he, &quot;to advise you, but I know there is no use in 
			giving you advice. (My aunt was his mother in law.) She has heard, 
			and the whole family has heard, that you are connected with these 
			drillings and marchings that are taking place every night in the 
			country around, and they are all greatly troubled about yon. I said 
			I would speak to you. I know it be of little use to try and dissuade 
			you from what you are doing, but you have a wife and young children, 
			and I ask you, is it wise for you to be trusting your safety to such 
			and such persons, who may be tempted by large sums of money to 
			betray you?&quot; Here he mentioned the names of several men, who had not 
			much of the world's goods, whom suspicious and rumor set down as 
			belonging to the rebel society. I listened to him with that respect 
			I owed him. I tried to calm his fears. I told him the poorest of our 
			people—those who had felt the tyranny most—were the truest of our 
			people. In reading Humboldt's &quot;Cosmos&quot; I Came across a passage which 
			beautifully expresses that idea. He says if you dig deep down into 
			the bowels of the earth the lower down you go the warmer you will 
			find the soil; the same way it is, he says, with oppressed peoples, 
			the lower down you go amongst them the warmer and the truer you will 
			find them to the cause of liberty and nationality. I have 
			experienced that to be true of the Irish people, and I am not 
			speaking without saying as much experience of them as any other man 
			living to-day has. I have traveled in England, Ireland and Scotland 
			in connection with the Irish revolutionary movement. I have been in 
			the principal cities in England and Scotland, and have spoken in 
			organization with the humblest of the Irish people. I have traveled 
			thirty-one of the thirty [sic] counties of Ireland, meeting swarms 
			of men of the organization. I was put in prison in September, '63. I 
			was brought to trial in December, '63. During the three months I was 
			awaiting trial any amount of money would be given to any one to come 
			forward to swear against me, and not one of the many thousands of 
			men I met in Liverpool Manchester, Birmingham, Sheffield, 
			Wolverhampton, Wigan, Bolton, Oldham, Leeds, Nottingham, London, 
			Bradford, Burnley, Preston. Darlington, Shields, Newcastle, Shads, 
			Jarrow, Edinburgh, Glasgow and other places came forward to take the 
			English bribe; not one of the thousand I met from Antrim Head to 
			Cape Clear came on the witness table to swear against me. I take a 
			pride In saying this; I take a pride in saying it of the Irish 
			people; I am proud of them to-day, and of their fidelity to the 
			cause of their oppressed fatherland. A few false men have from time 
			to time turned up here and there in Ireland's history. Where is the 
			country with a history such as Ireland's that has not produced 
			traitors? I maintain that Ireland's history has fewer of them than 
			any other; and because that such traitors have arisen in all nations 
			struggling for freedom, and will arise again, is no reason why 
			Irishmen should not carry on the fight.</font></p>

			&quot;The Assyrian came down like a wolf on the fold.&quot; The English came 
			down on us in the dead of night, broke down the doors of houses that 
			were not readily opened to their knock. routed us out of bed and 
			took us to the police barracks, and when day broke and we looked at 
			each other we saw that every man was a prisoner who, some evenings 
			before, went out of curiosity to have a look at Sullivan Goula. 
			During the night police from outlying stations had been drafted into 
			town; at nine o'clock in the morning every one of us wee handcuffed 
			to two policemen, and in coaches and cars we were driven from our 
			homes amid the crying of wives and sisters and mothers, and the 
			crying and cheering of the men and boys of the town.</font></p>

			The City of Cork seemed to be our destination, but nobody could tell 
			where we were to rest. About nine o'clock at night we reached 
			Bandon, the cars drove up to the jail door, and this seemed to be 
			our journey's end for that day. The jail door opened hospitably to 
			receive us; we were ushered in, our chains were unbound and we were 
			led to our apartments. I was lodged in a cell in which were three 
			other men, William O'Shea, Jerry Cullinane and Tim McCarthy, of 
			Bantry; in Skibboreen that morning, and the Bantry men had arrived 
			before us. Rain had been falling all the evening and the cell was 
			flooded with water. We had to eat our supper perched on the plank 
			bedstead. We had not much sleep, but we talked and tumbled all night 
			till morning.</font></p>
			<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify"><font size="4">
			Well, we did something more than talk too; we drank; we had whisky. 
			One of the policemen, who was handcuffed to me all day, went out of 
			the jail when he was released from me, and purchased a bottle of 
			whisky; he came back to the jail, made some excuse to the jailor for 
			seeing me, and left the bottle in the cell. Some of these Irish 
			policemen are Irishmen. I knew several of them to be sworn in, but 
			they cannot be depended on as a body to do any revolutionary work 
			for Ireland. But, what am I saying? sure the Irishmen who are not 
			policemen cannot be depended on as a body to work of that kind.</font></p>
			<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify"><font size="4">
			The Irishmen who are on the Irish police are not much different from 
			the Irishmen who hold situations outside the police department. They 
			are paid for doing a certain duty, they make their living by doing 
			it, and they do it. If they could make their living in a decenter 
			manner, many would prefer to live the decenter way. I say of them as 
			I say of many Irishmen who are not policemen: they will never create 
			or commence, a revolution, because they will never peril their way 
			of living; but if Ireland once could take the field and hold the 
			field for any time against the enemy; if Irishmen could fight and 
			win one small battle, which would show the Irish police they meant 
			fight and were in earnest and would; give protection and 
			co-operation to any one who would, side with them, then I say you 
			would have the great majority of the Irish police fighting at the 
			side of Ireland instead of at the side of England. You would also, 
			under such circumstances, have many of the Irish redcoats fighting 
			with you. But those are things&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Irish revolutionists must 
			not depend upon; they must; calculate on doing their work without 
			such contingent aid as the defection from England of the Irish 
			peelers and redcoats. It has been England's policy to keep Ireland 
			in such poverty as will oblige Irishmen to take service in her army 
			and navy and police. Irishmen thus are forced into the doing of 
			England's dirty work, and they do it from necessity, not from 
			choice. I never knew an Irishman to become an English peeler or 
			soldier who could pay the price of his passage to America. I know 
			cases which form exceptions to what I here say; I know that some 
			landlords exact it as a kind of favor from their tenantry that they 
			send some of their children to join the police or some the navy. The 
			landlord will visit the tenant and see the children; the eldest or 
			the second eldest boy is growing very tall, and the landlord tells 
			the boy's father he thinks he has influence enough to get him on the 
			police. The father dare not say &quot;I don't want my boy on the police.&quot; 
			He knows what the landlord means; he means that it is a kind of 
			guarantee for the loyalty of the family to have one of them in the 
			English service, and the father, much against his will, consents to 
			have his boy made a peeler of. I know many a decent father and 
			mother's son to have joined the police and joined the navy under the 
			circumstances I now state. The education of the police recruit all 
			tends to develop any tendency to hardness the man may have in him. 
			He sees before him that the way to promotion lies through meanness, 
			through petty persecution and spying upon his own people, and 
			through sycophancy and subserviency to their persecutors. The police 
			recruit is never allowed to do duty in the county he was born in; he 
			is removed to a far away county, where there &nbsp;are no family friends 
			or neighbors to favor or to frown upon him for doing things that 
			would be disgraceful to his family. So much for the Irish police in 
			the Fenian movement. It was the bottle of whisky one of them gave me 
			set me talking about them. Whisky, after all, does make a man talk 
			sometimes.</font></p>
