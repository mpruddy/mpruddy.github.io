	<p align="justify"><font size="4"><b>The file linked below was created to 
	explore intermarriage and descendants as related to several McNulty families 
	originating in Dromore, County Tyrone, Ireland. These McNulty's began 
	arriving in the early 1800s to Harper's Ferry, Virginia, with later Dromore 
	McNulty's arriving to New York&nbsp; and other destinations on the east 
	coast of the United States. There are three separate groups who may have 
	been related back in Dromore.&nbsp; </b>
	</font></p>
    <p align="justify"><font size="4"><b> My family is descended from Charles and Mary 
	McNulty of Dromore who are the parents of my great grandparents from that area
    Bernard and Alice (McPike) McNulty. Bernard arrived in 1851 to New York and
    made his way to Shullsburg. Another family, is that of Owen McNulty, who
    arrived in the 1860's and made his way to Shullsburg got married and then
    settled in Emmetsburg, Palo Alto County, Iowa. Owen was the son of Michael
    McNulty and Rose Ann McCusker of Dromore. One of Owen's sons, John Patrick
    married Bernard McNulty's daughter Alice Bridget in 1905 .</b></font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font size="4"><b>Thanks to a McNulty researcher named
    Wiliam Brewster Cockrell, who is descended from Thomas McNulty, I have a
    payroll record for Thomas and John McNulty when they were working at the
    Harper's Ferry armory in Virginia in 1825. Also there is a probable hit on
    Thomas McNulty in the 1830 US Census for Harper's Ferry. It is important to
    note that I have no information that connects the brothers, Thomas and John
    McNulty who worked at Harpers Ferry in Virginia, to either Owen McNulty or
    my great grandfather Bernard McNulty who homesteaded in West Albany,
    Minnesota other than the fact that Owen and Bernard and their families,
    shortly after arriving to America from Dromore in County Tyrone, Ireland and
    that both families passed through the Shullsburg area where Thomas and John
    had settled in the 1830s. I must also acknowledge the help of dozens of McNulty researchers and relatives with whom I have communicated over the years.&nbsp;&nbsp; </b>
	</font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font size="4"><b>The McNulty's of Harper's Ferry
    Virginia:<br>
    Thomas McNulty was born in Ireland in 1783 and married Mary McLaughlin born
    in Harper's Ferry Virginia in 1825. There were 6 children that I found.
    [from the ages and circumstances Mary was probably a second wife married
    perhaps the death of a first wife. The children were born between 1812 and
    1833] she out lived him by almost 40 years. Thomas died 1859 and Mary died
    1893.&nbsp; Two of Thomas' Children I have listed as born in Virginia.
    Thomas arrived in Shullsburg in about the same time as John.<br>
    John McNulty was born abt 1791 in Ireland, John was Thomas' brother. John
    married Mary McAleer who was born in Pennsylvania in 1825. Once again the
    likelihood is that she is a second wife since his 9 children were born from
    1827 to&nbsp; 1858. He died in 1865 and Mary died aft 1880. The first child
    of John was born in Wisconsin by my notes and the second was born in
    Jefferson County, Virginia with John arriving in Shullsburg in 1836. John's
    son Patricus I show born in Harper's Ferry, Virginia and the last two, Jane
    and Emma, twins, I show born in 1858 in Shullsburg. I estimate that both
    Thomas and John went back to Virginia to get their wives after establishing
    themselves in Shullsburg.&nbsp;<br>
    <br>
    All that said, I re-emphasize that there is nothing connecting Thomas and
    John with the other McNulty families other than the fact all the later
    McNulty's that I have tracked from Dromore area in Ireland went through
    Shullsburg when they came to the US. This includes Owen's family who went to
    Iowa and also my family who went to Minnesota.<br>
 </b>
	</font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font size="4"><b> These families 
	all settled or passed through the town of Shullsburg, Lafayette County, 
	Wisconsin where the original Harper's Ferry McNulty's had settled around 
	1838.&nbsp;&nbsp; After locating in Shullsburg most of these men moved on to Oakwood Township 
	and its surrounding area in Wabasha County, Minnesota. One brother of the 
	Wabasha McNulty's, Joseph McNulty, settled in Perham, Ottertail County, Minnesota.&nbsp; </b>
	</font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font size="4"><b>When you scroll to surnames in the file you will note that I use Dromore McNulty as a 
	fictitious name to cover all McNulty men who came from Dromore Ireland that 
	have been found to be connected into the Wabasha McNulty's. &quot;Dromore 
	McNulty&quot; has two actual children Michael McNulty and Michael's brother John 
	which are the oldest generation of actual McNulty men traced back to Dromore. 
	Listed as Children are three other lines Thomas &amp; John's Father McNulty, 
	Charles' Father McNulty and Patrick's Father McNulty. These are place 
	holders for lines traced back to one generation before Michael and John so 
	the lineage will remain more or less in chronological order.</b></font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font size="4"><b> Bernard 
	  McNulty who arrived in the United States aboard the ship Harriet from Liverpool 
	  in October of 1851, and then went to Shullsburg, Wisconsin, about 1854 he 
	  settled down on his farm in Oakwood Township in Minnesota. He was followed 
	  by his brothers Cormack, Charles, James while another brother in law, Joseph, went to Perham, 
	  Minnesota. Edward and John are listed as a brothers to these men but of these connections 
	  we are not sure and more must be done to prove the relationship. </b></font></p>
  <p align="justify"><p align="center"><font size="5"><b>Bernard McNulty: Farmer or Fenian or Both?&nbsp;</p>
  <p align="justify"><font size="4">My grandmother, Annie McNulty, visited us when I was in the seventh grade. One of the family stories she told was that her father, Bernard McNulty, was a hedgerow schoolteacher in Ireland and was a member of the Fenian Brotherhood, an Irish Americans nationalist society. When I later took an interest in my genealogy and contemplated Bernard’s Fenian connection, it seemed odd to me that a farmer trying to provide for a large family in the untamed wilderness of Minnesota in the 1850s would be actively involved in the cause of Irish nationalism. Long after Grandma Annie’s death I began to look for source documents that might corroborate her belief in Bernard’s Fenian activity. I accumulated all the extant material I could locate, hoping to gain an insight into what part my great-grandfather might have played in the Fenian organization. During that fifteen years of research, I found an unsourced entry in a genealogical book (Edward MacLysagt, Irish Families, p. 137 (Dublin, 1957) that stated “Bernard McNulty (died 1892), friend of John Boyle O’Reilly, was the founder of the first branch of the Fenian Brotherhood in the USA;” this man later proved to be a different Bernard McNulty (grave states "Bernard Nulty") of New Jersey  who died the same year as my Bernard. This Bernard born 1842 was from County Donegal not Tyrone. No document encountered during my research into the history of the Fenian Brotherhood mentions my grandfather. If a Fenian, Bernard certainly could have been a member of any local Fenian Circle in Wabasha, Minnesota but only family stories say he was, perhaps after encountering the New Jersey Bernard (Mc)Nulty I found above. Curiosity fed by my research into great-grandfather’s supposed role in the Fenian Movement led to my in-depth study of 19th Century Irish Americans nationalism.&nbsp;</p>
