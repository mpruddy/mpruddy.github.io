        Mary Virginia Payson Terhune who wrote using the pen name
        Mario Harland. She was mother of Albert Payson Terhune

        You are all anxious to hear a word and just one word I
        can write. I am well and all right. I wrote last on the
        12th from this place. We had a fight on that day. I had a
        horse shot - a splendid gray. Thro&#146; the neck used
        him up. We were fighting cavalry. Next day we went for
        them again and whipped them thoroughly. Captured their
        artillery and 15 prisoners. Drove them into the mtns
        while leading a charge with a dozen men. I had my other
        horse shot dead. We charged up a hill and were within 30
        feet of their line when &quot;Old Tom&quot; fell. A
        square shot thro&#146; the head &#150; no doubt it saved
        my life. Three inches higher would have taken me in the
        breast. I am here now with an ambulance train from
        Gaylesville with sick and wounded. We had a fight
        Saturday. Hood[General John B Hood CSA] is near Blue Mts.

        Ten miles below Gayleville<br>
        Oct 26th 1864</b><p><b>Dear Father<br>
        I wrote a line from Rome on Sunday. I got back all safe
        and sound and joined the command last night. The Division
        excepting our brigade is out about 10 miles to the front.
        I am not posted as to Hood&#146;s whereabouts but believe
        he will come up somewhere in Tennessee. That is the
        opinion of the most who do not know with certainty. The
        rebels are acting very desperate. I believe Sherman
        wishes him (Hood) to go to Tenn. if he will. Hood&#146;s
        attempt to compel Sherman to evacuate Atlanta so far is a
        failure and is likely to so indefinite time. And the
        hopes which influence the rebel leaders to act so
        desperately in order to bear unfavorably on the
        reelection of Mr Lincoln will be destined to
        disappointment and defeat. When I wrote you upon my
        political ideas, I gave you my objections to the policy
        of Mr Lincoln&#146;s Administration and also told you I
        could not vote for Gen McClellan. Altho&#146; I do not
        agree with Lincoln in those things and know they can
        never be carried out. Yet when called upon to choose
        between him and McClellan I will vote for Lincoln. I dare
        not risk Mac upon such a platform and I think a change
        would be injurious to us and encourage the rebels and it
        might be taken in the eyes of foreign powers as a backing
        down. And this might possibly lead to a recognition of
        the South. And if so and attempt to raise the Blockade.
        You will not get this probably until after the 4th Nov. I
        shall vote for Lincoln and four more years of war with
        the rebels rather than McClellan and the recognition of
        the South by England and France and consequently a war
        with these powers.<br>
        Our Regiment is very small. We have not many over 100 men
        with us I have been comd&#146;g batt. Since the
        Kilpatrick raid. There is a prospect of us being sent to
        remount before long. I hope we will by all means we have
        rec&#146;d no pay yet. I did have two good horses as
        there was in the regiment until our fight at Rome. We
        charged three times one day with Sabres. I led the last
        charge and it was there my best horse was killed. We
        charged up a hill 12 of us upon about 30 rebels. My horse
        was a large sorrel with a star in the forehead. With a
        splendid curb neck and roughed mane. And was a
        conspicuous mark. He was shot square in the head, one
        inch above the star. He was on the jump when hit. His
        head was high and it saved me. He fell and never
        struggled once. Poor Old Tom! I went over the ground
        Monday. The only wonder was that we were not all killed.
        They fired two vollies before they broke. But too high.<br>

        Soldiers vote as they fight systematically. As far as
        heard from Lincoln is far ahead. Little Mac [Gen George
        McClellan-USA] gets the cold shoulder of all the army and
        deserves nothing better for standing on such a platform.
        We prefer Lincoln and four more years of war if need be

        think intends to evacuate Atlanta and cut loose from all
        supplies and sweep a broad track thro&#146; Georgia and
        the Confederacy, leaving Thomas to look after Hood and
        make our line the Tenn River for future operations.
        Nothing would demoralize the South more in her present

        of others which make many new officers. Our horses are

        sorrel horses for my company. Always had bays before do
        not like the<br>
        changes. We have pressed a great many horses in the City.
        Before I got<br>
        back our regiment was stationed on every road leading out
        of the city to<br>
        take all horses coming out or going in and all we could
        find in the stables<br>
        anywhere in the city. Rather droll times it made too.
        Twas not strange to<br>
        see a man drawing his own carriage or holding up the neck
        yoke on one side<br>
        while one horse which the boys would not take drawing his
        wagon along. Even<br>
        now you will see drays turned up along the road where
        horses have been<br>
        taken. The livery stables were all gutted of their fast
        stock and Uncle<br>
        Sam&#146;s boys are now riding them by their old owners
        doors in triumph.<br>
        Government pays about $150 now for horses.<br>

        Have you bought the Knowles place yet or can&#146;t you
        get a bargain out of<br>
        the old man, get it if you can, we can&#146;t do better.<br>

        <br>
        Dear Father<br>
        <br>
        We are laying in camp today about one mile north of Duck
        River waiting for<br>
        the bridge to be finished.<br>
        <br>
        We left Nashville on Thursday and arrived here last
        night. Passed through<br>
        Franklin, and Spring Hill and over the battle ground at
        Franklin. The<br>
        hardest fighting was in a clear open field not even a
        stump of bush for<br>
        shelter. The ground is dotted thick with graves in
        clusters of from a<br>
        dozen to 30 and 40 and down to single ones here and
        there. It was a<br>
        terrible fight.<br>
        <br>
        It is a clear pleasant day. I hope our bad weather is
        over. We have had<br>
        some very cold disagreeable times since we left
        Louisville.<br>
        <br>
        I see by Friday&#146;s Paper there is really some
        prospect of Peace in earnest<br>
        and hope it may prove to be a reality this time. We have
        had so many<br>
        rumors of peace that have proved false that these are
        generally put down as<br>
        such but the fact that Stephens is reported as one of the
        Commissioners<br>
        makes it almost seem as if this has some truth in it.<br>
        <br>
        I wrote you from Nashville don&#146;t know how long we
        will stay here. Our<br>
        wagons are out after ferrys we may stop here two or three
        days. Write when<br>
        you can. Love to all<br>

        Dear Sister<br>
        <br>
        I rec&#146;d another letter from you tonight dated Apr
        31st telling me of John<br>
        Castner&#146;s death and Briggs Maning&#146;s and stating
        that you had written the<br>
        same before. I have not recd any letters between dates
        Apr 8 and 31st.<br>
        <br>
        The $20 dollars from John came thro&#146; safe - recd it
        Sunday. Was surprised<br>
        to hear of John&#146;s death. He was such a healthy
        fellow. What ailed him? I<br>
        thought much of John.<br>
        <br>
        You have doubtless heard that Jeff Davis was captured by
        the 4th Mich<br>
        Cavalry. He is now on his way to Washington. You will
        also know, I<br>
        presume, a lot of stories of his capture. Our regiment
        was not all out. I<br>
        was the one that staid back in Macon. I was President of
        the Board of<br>
        Examination for a candidate for commission in colored
        regiments and was<br>
        ordered to stay by the Brigade command. I am thus
        particular in telling why<br>
        I was not out &#150; for those men and officers names who
        went out will probably<br>
        be published and a great blow made about their bravery. I
        do not think any<br>
        particular man or officer is entitled to more credit
        because he happened to<br>
        be with the party that captures Jeff &#150; they were
        lucky that&#146;s all, While I<br>
        and Maj. Eldredge[L Briggs Eldredge, Lapeer, MI] and
        others who staid back<br>
        on duty are unlucky. There was no bravery about it.
        Davis&#146; whole party<br>
        numbered only about 25 and we surprised them while in
        bed. And there would<br>
        not have been a shot fired at all if he 1st Wisconsin
        Cavalry which was<br>
        hunting for Jeff and came up after our regiment had taken
        him had not<br>
        mistaken us for the enemy. The two regiments had quite a
        fight - we lost<br>
        two killed and one officer wounded.<br>
        <br>
        It will make a good record for the old 4th to go home
        with.<br>
        <br>
        It is late and I must close. Don&#146;t know when I will
        get home - don&#146;t be<br>
        impatient I shall come as soon as I can. The war is
        ended. Love to you and<br>

        Dear Father<br>
        <br>
        I rec&#146;d a letter from Amelia dated Apr 31st which is
        the latest I have from<br>
        home. We are expecting a mail in a day or two from
        Savannah. The first on<br>
        we rec&#146;d came via Mobile, the second via Chattanooga
        and Atlanta.<br>
        <br>
        We are having very warm weather here but a fine shower
        last night has laid<br>
        the dust a day or two. Wheat is nearly ripe. We have
        green peas, radishes,<br>
        and mulberries and strawberries are about all gone. Will
        have cucmbers in<br>
        a few days. Cherries are getting ripe.<br>
        <br>
        We keep hearing rumors of moving all the time but
        don&#146;t know how much truth<br>
        there is in that story. When we do move I think we will
        move towards the<br>
        Tennessee River and also towards home. I rather think we
        will be mustered<br>
        out before the 28th of August but will not be
        disappointed if we are not.<br>
        The time at any rate will soon pass around.<br>
        <br>
        I suppose you have seen or will the particulars of
        Davis&#146; capture before<br>
        this reaches you. He is now on his way to Washington.
        Col. Pritchard is<br>
        alos gone. He has been recommended for Bvt. Brig. Gen. I
        understand by<br>
        Gen [James] Wilson - if it hadn&#146;t been for my bein
        on a Board of<br>
        Examination I should have been along, when the regiment
        went out, after<br>
        him, and shared the honor. I hear there are to be medals
        given to those<br>
        who took a prart inm his capture - so far as the bravery
        is concerned , and<br>
        all that which you will see in the papers, that is all
        nonsense. There was<br>
        men along at his capture that never fired a gun since
        they came into the<br>
        service. But the fact that they gobbled up old Jeff will
        be enough to put<br>
        their name in history - us fellows that staid back claim
        the honor of<br>
        belonging to the old 4th Mich Cavalry and are satisfied
        with that.<br>
        <br>
        When I was at Chickamauga I sent to you or John for a
        pair of boots, if you<br>
        have not sent them, you need not. I have had me a pair
        made at Macon. I<br>
        got all the stock for nothing except the fronts for which
        I paid $2. It is<br>
        fine French Calf, paid $5 for making them. Whole cost $7.
        Sewed boot.<br>
        Cheap enough. I am also getting me a suit of citizens
        clothes made here it<br>
        is rather homely but they charged $2.50 per yard at the
        stores in the city<br>
        all the suit costs me is the making of it.<br>
        <br>
        I am also getting me up a saddle here which I shall bring
        home with me. We<br>
        captured here in the arsenals some of the finest leather
        I ever saw. It<br>
        is English leather Russet and has run the blockade. The
        saddle tree was<br>
        made here our saddler Sergeant is covering it for me. I
        am havin ti made<br>
        in regular Mexican style, Gambadoer, Zapideros and all.
        The saddle in<br>
        Detroit will be worth $50. It will cost me about $15. <br>
        <br>
        Our Head Quarters are in a house. A very cosy place by
        the way so much<br>
        more cool than a tent. <br>
        <br>
        Well the great Slaveholder&#146;s rebellion is over and
        its leaders are nearly<br>
        all in our possession. I have seen and talked with
        biggest one among them<br>
        all - Jeff Davis. We all think he will be hung and hope
        so too. I feel<br>
        sorry for his wife and children &#150; not so much for
        her as the children, for<br>
        she is haughty, scornful and insulting as any women I
        ever saw. If she is<br>
        a lady, I failed to discover it. But the children are
        pretty and innocent<br>
        as yet and I pity them. I have seen Howell Cobb also an
        ugly looking old<br>
        devil - needs hanging.<br>
        <br>
        As a general thing, every one down here admits they are
        whipped thourought<br>
        and they are now anxious to know what we-uns will do with
        them - they know<br>
        they lose their slaves and many of them will not be
        disappointed if they<br>
        lose their land too. The Southern soldiers are gland it
        is over, to a man<br>
        and are willing to say they are whipped , tho&#146; most
        of them will make good<br>
        citizens - if we have any more trouble here it will be
        from some brawling<br>
        cowards who have staid home while their relations were
        fighting for them in<br>
        a place where they dare not go. My motto is hang the
        leaders the rest of<br>
        the bad ones will subside or leave the country.<br>

        through by land. We will leave this place tomorrow
        morning for Chattanooga<br>
        by land. Will get there the latter part of next week. I
        am well as usual.<br>
        Our boys are very healthy generally. We are having warm
        dusty marching but<br>
        thank [?] we are going where it is cooler. Cannot tell
        when I will reach<br>
        home. We will march to Nashville with our stock if
        possible. May be home<br>
        by July 21st but hardly expect to. This city is a perfect
        wreck. All the<br>
        business part is burned. I stay at the Gate City House
        tonight the only<br>
        hotel I the place. My love to all. Will write from
        Chattanooga.<br>
        <br>
        Your affectionately<br>
