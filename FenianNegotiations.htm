				headquarters, that General O’Neill represented the major part of

				<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

				“That the directory be formed of (4) from each party represented

				other one for him, could show he had any number of adherents, 
				they were willing to recognize the fact and treat with them; 
				that no party had come forward claiming any such representation; 
				and it was time enough to consider it when they did; that any 
				recognition of General O’Neill, under the circumstances , would 
				not , and could not, be tolerated, even had not his betrayal of 
				the trust placed in him forever put him beyond the recognition 
				of his countrymen. </b></p>
				<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

				<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

				shall be remitted to the IRB and 5 per cent or 10 per cent used 
				to run the Organization, the balance of 75 per cent to be

				the Directory only in case of war or for military purposes.”</b></p>
				<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

				<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
