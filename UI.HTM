<P class=Style1 align=center>&nbsp;</P>
<P class=Style1 align=left><B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In June-July of 1880 Jeremiah O'Donovan Rossa, a 
member of the secret Irish nationalist society the Clan Na Gael, called a convention of his adherents,
mostly subscribers to his newspaper the <i>United Irishman,</i> to form an 
Irish nationalist society&nbsp; in order to unify efforts of all Irish
nationalists in America. Among these societies were the two, at odds, Fenian
factions, the secretive Clan Na Gael (also called the United Brotherhood) and
some other smaller groups . About 150 men attended. Many were members, expelled-members, and 
would-be members of the Clan Na Gael, which thoroughly enraged John Devoy,
executive of the 
Clan Na Gael and a personal friend of Rossa.&nbsp;</B></P>
<P class=Style1 align=left>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> Rossa called his new society
the &quot;United Irishmen." 
The minutes and constitution of the inaugural convention are transcribed below. 
The name "United Irishmen" chosen is significant in that it recalls the United 
Irishmen rebellion defeated in County Wexford Ireland in 1798 where both Irish Protestants and Irish Catholics 
fought together (on the same side back then) against 
England.&nbsp;</b></P>
<P class=Style1 align=left>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> The convention devoted
significant time to finding out what was going to happen to the
&quot;Skirmishing Fund&quot; set up by Rossa. John Devoy had been instrumental in wresting the "Skirmishing 
Fund" (see below) out of Rossa's control and setting up a group of trustees,
mostly from the Clan Na Gael, to oversee the future use of the funds. Rossa did
agree to the trustees set up for the fund and this put him into a predicament
with his contributors.&nbsp;</b></P>
<P class=Style1 align=left><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The &quot;Skirmishing
Fund&quot; later on came under control of the &quot;Triangle,&quot; three
members of the Clan Na Gael led by Alexander Sullivan of Chicago, which
re-instituted Rossa's original scheme and began what is called the
&quot;Dynamite War&quot; against England in which sent many terrorists over to
England to bomb public places against the express wishes of the IRB. John Devoy
successfully ousted the &quot;Triangle&quot; from the Clan Na Gael and regained
control but at the cost of the life of his friend Dr. Patrick Cronin of a
Chicago Camp of the Clan Na Gael.&nbsp; For information on the
&quot;Triangle&quot; see the bibliography given below.</b></P>
<P class=Style1 align=left>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> Thanks to Heber McWilliams, a
descendent of Colonel William McWilliams a participant at the convention, we
have accumulated some newspaper events leading up to the meeting in
Philadelphia.</b></P>
<P class=Style1 align=left><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</b> <B>In the last 
sentence of the first paragraph in the notes on the &quot;Skirmishing Fund&quot; given below, 
the doom of the United Irishmen society is foretold by Rossa himself as the 
convention did, in fact, dilute its purpose and inaugurated a committee to investigate
what the &quot;trustees&quot; were planning to do with the the &quot; Skirmishing
Fund' money. The committee, which included the Convention President, John Brennan, then 
left the convention on a futile hunt to find the trustees. Upon 
the return of the committee empty-handed, the Convention then added O'Donovan 
Rossa to the committee. As the note at the front of the Convention Constitution 
indicates no progress in securing information on the fund was made by the time of publishing.&nbsp;</B></P>
<P class=Style1 align=left>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> Below are given Baltimore
newspaper clippings about the convention and notes from <U>Devoy's Post Bag </U>Vol II p560 and,
finally, the transcription of the minutes of the 
United Irishmen Convention.</b></P>
<P class=Style1 align=left>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> Perhaps too engrossed in the whereabouts of the
&quot;Skirmishing Fund,&quot; the United Irishmen ceased to exist after a few months (see

<P class=Style1 align=left><font size="3"><b>This fund was started by O'Donovan
Rossa using his newspaper the <i>United Irishman</i> to solicit money to do
damage to Great Britain wherever it was possible. Rossa was overtly suggesting
in his columns in the <i>United Irishman</i> that with such a fund terrorist
type acts could be made to coerce Britian into granting Ireland freedom.&nbsp;
Many Irish trusted Rossa with their funds and subscribed to create mischief in
England in whatever way he saw fit. The super-secret Clan Na Gael was not happy
with openly provoking Britain and calling attention to Irish nationalist
activities in America. They also did not want to perform acts in England without
approval of the IRB, the Fenian organization in Ireland, who was also against
random acts of terrror.</b></font></P>

Rossa, in "an Invitation to the Trustees ", issued in Philadelphia over his 
name, published by "The United Irish Clubs," and dated June 4, 1880, wrote: “. . 
. Many men who have contributed to the" Skirmishing Fund” seem to hold me still 
responsible for the expenditure of their contributions, and they write to me 
saying they are determined to bring me to account for their money at the 
approaching convention in Philadelphia on June 28th. Situated as I am, I am in 
no position to render any account to them, and I have written to them, telling 
them if we cannot do any better work at this convention than inaugurate a court 
of inquiry about the past, we had better have no convention at all.<BR>" But 
they are not satisfied with this reply of mine: they say they contributed their 
money for skirmishing purposes, as laid down in my first appeal in 1876, and 
having seen no work clone since then, I must account to them. All 1 can do is to 
appeal to you to come to my aid. I delivered up to you in 1878 my part of the 
trusteeship. And I ask you, or one of you, to come to the convention in 
Philadelphia, and product: the bonds and moneys I left in "your possession when 
I resigned.<BR>"With what you received since, I have nothing to do.<BR>" Men 
from New York, Philadelphia, Fall River, Boston, Memphis, Chicago, Peoria, and 
other towns, who contributed liberally to the Skirmishing Fund, will be present 
at the convention. At the time you were admitted as co-trustees of the 
Skirmishing Fund, they belonged to a society in deference to whose wishes you 
were appointed-subject to the approval of Mr. James Clancy, Austin Ford, and 
myself-and to which society they may still belong.<BR>" You will be at liberty 
to select from the Skirmishing contributors at that convention six men to act 
with three men of my selection, as a private sworn committee to whom you can 
make your manifest report. Or, you can select six men from the following 
contributors to the Skirmishing Fund, and I will select 
three<BR><O:P></O:P></b></SPAN></P>

Two hundred and fifty replies, with nearly a thousand signatures, were opened at a meeting of the committee today.  Of the votes cast, Philadelphia was the choice.
