		opportunities for education as the village school afforded, and this, 
		limited as it was, was cut short when about sixteen years old, by the 
		death of his father, who was a weaver. The boy went to Skibbereen and

		in some three years was joined by all the family, save Jeremiah, who, 
		proceeding on the route as far as Cork, turned back, feeling that he 
		could not and would not desert the old land. His heart yearned to her 
		and the hopes of her freedom, and he determined to watch and wait. This 
		determination led to remarkable and widely historical results.</font></b></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"><b><font size="4">O'Donovan married 
		and settled to business. The efforts of July and September, 1848, had 
		proved abortive, the little affair&nbsp; of Cappoquin, of the following year, 
		was scarcely heard of, except by important&nbsp; nationalists; the plans of 
		Fintan Lalor, Brenan and their comrades, as sketched by Luby, had come 
		to nought ; the Keoghs and the Sadliers were rising on the ruins of the 
		nationalists, when a few young men in Skibbereen determined to stir up 
		the embers of the national cause and keep it alive, even if in a 
		smouldering condition. Mr. Mortimer Moynahan, who had taught school for 
		five years in Glengariffe, took up his residence in Skibbereen in 1856 ; 
		and soon after his arrival O'Donovan and lie, having exchanged views on 
		the matter, and being joined by some congenial spirits, decided on 
		organizing a Society. The Emmet Monument Association was in being in 
		America, and they thought they could perhaps put themselves in 
		communication with it, and be the means of interchanging views and 
		helping the Irish cause on both sides of the Atlantic. The Society thus 
		formed in 1857, was ostensibly a literary society, similar, in most

		National and Literary Society,&quot; was suggested by O'Donovan, as he said 
		they intended to rise from the ashes of apathetic political huckstering, 
		which then covered the land. There was no oath, but the members took a 
		pledge indicative of the object—the resuscitation, ever so slowly, of 
		national life in Ireland. The meetings were duly held, and the Phoenix 
		Society spread itself rapidly into the adjacent towns. It had 
		considerable antagonists to encounter, as it met no favor from the 
		clergy, whom it did not court ; nor from the political agitators, whom 
		it condemned ; nor from the traders, who regarded it as a band of 
		disturbers ; nor from the farmers, &quot;who thought of little save high 
		prices.&quot; Its local repute was that of persons holding extreme radical 
		views on Irish questions ; and this was brought into still wider notice 
		by a meeting held in 1858—at the time of the Indian meeting—at which 
		resolutions and an inflammatory address were passed. &quot; On the 
		publication of these documents,&quot; writes Mr. Moynahan, &quot; the little 
		shoneen* shop keepers banned us as a lot of firebrands, and threatened 
		with dismissal such of their employees as would any logger continue to 
		be members of the Society. For these reasons the Society dwindled down 
		to a few members, when Stephens made his appearance. He had some time

		it was pushed into Bantry, Ken- mare, Killarney, Castletown, Berehaven, 
		Dunmannaway, Clonakilty, and Macroom by the Skibbereen men, and into 
		Kinsale and Cork by equally energetic brothers. Moynahan, who was 
		connected with a solicitor, and used to accompany him to the Sessions 
		and Assizes, took these occasions for propagating the order, which he 
		did as far off as Kilorglin in Kerry ; while O'Donovan worked with great

		Kenmare. The attention thus given to the Phoenix Society, as it was 
		still called, attracted the inquiry of some journalists ; and a

		for some weeks, several of the Cork prisoners were discharged, but true 
		bills were found against Mortimer Moynahan, William O'Shea, Denis 
		Sullivan, Mortimer Downing, Daniel McCartie, Jeremiah O'Donovan (Rossa), 
		and Patrick Downing, for treason-felony. An immediate trial was sought 
		for them, by counsel, but, on motion of the Attorney- General, it was 
		postponed to the next Assizes. An application to be admitted to bail was 
		referred to the Queen's Bench, and failed. At the Tralee Assizes Mr. 
		Daniel O'Sullivan (Agreem) was convicted by a packed jury, and thus 
		became the first victim of the new national organization. Again the Cork 
		prisoners unsuccessfully applied to the Queen's Bench for release on 
		bail ; and about the same time a proposition was made by the Crown 
		counsel to the counsel for the prisoners, that if the latter would 
		withdraw their first plea, and plead guilty, they would be liberated. 
		This Rossa and his comrades declined. The Government then approached 
		them with another proposition—that if Rossa and Moynahan consented to 
		leave the country, the others would be liberated. On consultation the 
		prisoners agreed to enter into no compromise with the Government. A few 
		mornings subsequently, some further liberations took place, and Rossa, 
		Moynahan, and O'Shea, were all the &quot;Phoenix men&quot; who remained in Cork 
		jail. After keeping them in prison for eight months, the Government 
		found it could not convict them ; and finally Rossa and his associates 
		agreed to plead guilty and be liberated, with the understanding that 
		O'Sullivan, who had been convicted, should also be set free.</font></b></p>

		<p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"><b><font size="4">Rossa—as he was 
		now called—had a positive influence over the men of his neighborhood. 
		His course on the marriage of the Prince of Wales illustrates it. Some 
		of the &quot; gentry &quot; of Skibbereen had determined to honor the great event 
		in the life of the heir-apparent, and several of a club, of which Rossa 
		was a member, illuminated the club-room. On hearing it, he went to the 
		house and called a meeting of the club to protest against the 
		celebration ; but as none others attended it, he decided that the 
		illumination was contrary to the wish of the members, and immediately 
		tore down the flags and banners. By this time, others of the members 
		interfered. He, however, nothing daunted, carried out his object, and 
		prevented the celebration. The people, hearing of the occurrence, 
		rallied to his aid, and a grand meeting was called, which he addressed 
		to their satisfaction.</font></b></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"><b><font size="4">At the time of 
		the Polish insurrection, too, he headed a meeting and procession in 
		honor of that noble race ; and, having obtained some banners, they 
		paraded the streets of the town. Some of the banners being national in 
		their design, the police interfered, and all save one were obliged to be 
		dispensed with. This one was a puzzle to the police; it being three- 
		cornered, and having no device, they were allowed to use it, and thus 
		carried out their intentions despite opposition.</font></b></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"><b><font size="4">Scarcely a week

		<p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"><b><font size="4">struggle, 
		however, was an unequal one. In 1862 he came to New York, but in a few 
		months was recalled to Ireland by the death of his wife.</font></b></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"><b><font size="4">Of course, his 
		relations with Stephens, Luby, and the other chief men, were resumed, 
		and on the starting of the Irish People he became one of the registered 
		proprietors. He was one of °the first captured, and was brought to trial 
		at the Dublin Commission on the 9th December, 1865. On the next morning, 
		Rossa interrupted the Court to say that, as he believed the Crown was 
		determined to convict him, his trial was a legal farce, and that he 
		would not be a party to it by being represented by counsel. He could not 
		be prevailed on to accept legal advice, but conducted his own defence, 
		which led to some extraordinary scenes in Court, and some bitter 
		passages between the prisoner and Judge Keogh. The more the latter 
		hemmed himself within the walls of privilege, the more O'Donovan was 
		defiant, or satirical, as the occasion suggested. He persisted in 
		badgering the Court and ministers, and in thoroughly exploding the legal 
		farce. As he said in reply to Judge Fitzgerald, &quot; Twenty years &quot; (the 
		term of servitude given to his associates) &quot; is a long time, and I want 
		to spend a couple of days as best I can.&quot;</font></b></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"><b><font size="4">At the opening of 
		the Court on the 12th—the third day—when again put forward and called 
		upon for his defence, Rossa asked if he could have the privilege of 
		addressing the jury on the evidence produced against him by the Crown. 
		Judge Keogh read the act of Parliament for him, by which he was entitled 
		to open</font></b></p>

		<p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"><b><font size="4">his own case; 
		and, if he called any witnesses for his defence, to sum up after, or 
		speak to evidence.</font></b></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"><b><font size="4">The prisoner then 
		spoke at considerable length, though not in a direct or consecutive 
		manner, animadverting on the harshness of the Government towards him. 
		Referring to the jury, he said : The Attorney-General has ordered thirty 
		gentlemen to stand by, and no doubt he considered the present jury 
		persons who would bring in the verdict he wished. That observation might 
		not be complimentary to the jury, but he could not help it. The 
		Executive Government had taken harsh measures against the prisoners—had. 
		violated all law, and had had recourse to dark courses of despot-. ism. 
		If trial by jury prevented a man from saying that freedom might be 
		fought for, it was a mere bulwark of tyranny. The preliminaries had 
		been, he contended, so arranged as to deny him- a fair trial. The papers 
		had published articles condemning all the prisoners before they were 
		tried. He admitted he had proceeded to America under the name of 
		O'Donnell, but it was on mercantile business ; that name he had assumed 
		in order to prevent his political friends there from showering welcoming 
		receptions upon him. He returned not as O'Donnell, but in his proper 
		name as O'Donovan. The only crime he had committed was that he had known 
		James Stephens, John O'Mahony, J. O'Leary, and Luby. He was proud to 
		know them. He wished the reporters to take down that in the register of 
		the United States Government of the 27th of August, 1863, his oath of 
		American citizenship would be found recorded. After a violent attack on 
		Judge Keogh, the prisoner said, whatever might be the result of this 
		trial, he entertained no animosity against any person, from Nagle, the 
		informer, to Mr. Barry, or the judges on the bench. He thought it would 
		do good in England to show the sort of trial we had in this country. If 
		there was any gentleman belonging to the Continental press in Court, he 
		hoped he would take down the words of the London Times of the 14th of 
		November : &quot; Treason is a serious thing, and these men are undoubtedly 
		guilty of it:&quot; The reading of papers and documents by the prisoner at 
		this stage, occupied</font></b></p>

		<p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"><b><font size="4">above two hours. 
		Judge Keogh then refused to allow him to proceed with the reading of an 
		affidavit which had been sworn in the course of the action against the 
		Lord-Lieutenant, on the • ground that the public time could not be 
		frittered away, whereupon O'Donovan exclaimed, &quot;The time of the public 
		has been given to try me.&quot; The foreman of the jury also asked that the 
		prisoner should mark the documents for their consideration, and not read 
		them; but he answered that he had laid down a course for himself, in 
		consequence of the way in which he had been treated since he had been 
		sent to prison, which he could not depart from. He then read nearly a 
		hundred pages of small print, referring to the Constitution, 
		organization, and proceedings of the Chicago Convention; as to which, 
		Judge Keogh said, when the prisoner had concluded : &quot;It is scarcely 
		necessary to remark to the public press the grave responsibility that 
		would attach to the publication of the document which the prisoner has 
		read, under the pretext that it would form a necessary portion of his 
		defence.&quot;The prisoner said his object in reading the document was to 
		show that there was nothing in the Chicago Convention documents 
		referring to him. He afterwards read several articles from the Irish 
		People, and at six o'clock in the evening was still continuing his 
		readings, without any appearance of weariness. At this hour the judges 
		directed that their own dinners, and those of the jurymen, should be 
		brought down to Court ; and it was understood that the sitting would be 
		a late one, in order that, if possible, the prisoner should finish his 
		first speech that night. The prisoner asked if the Court would not 
		adjourn as usual, as he had now been reading for several hours, and was 
		wearied out. The only answer he received, was, to proceed with his 
		defence. He then offered to read some passages from the Irish People, 
		but Judge Keogh would not permit him to read anything that was not 
		specified in the indictment. He had announced his intention to examine a 
		witness to show that his visit to America was in reference to commercial 
		matters ; but after some further reading of the documents before him, he 
		announced that he could proceed no further without the papers kept back 
		by the Crown. He then sat down, having occupied nearly eight hours in 
		reading.</font></b></p>

		<p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"><b><font size="4">Before sentence

		indicted for a similar offence in July, 1859—an indictment for 
		treason-felony. &quot; On that occasion, he first pleaded not guilty, but 
		subsequently pleaded guilty. The clemency of the Crown was extended to 
		him then, he entering into recognizances to appear when called on. He 
		would call upon the Clerk of the Crown to enter the former conviction 
		upon the record.&quot;</font></b></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"><b><font size="4">Judge Keogh—&quot; Has
