        <p><strong>I suppose I should inform you of all my good
        luck, well then. I am now a 1</strong><sup><strong>st</strong></sup><strong>
        Lieutenant and in command of &quot;H&quot; company. The
        Capt (Abeel)[Alfred Abeel taken prisoner supposedly
        &#145;under a flag of truce&#146; before Stones River on
        Dec 21, 1862] is a prisoner in Atlanta, Ga. and will
        probably stay there some time. I am in full command and
        will be responsible for (--?) the same as Capt. I take Lt
        Leach&#146;s[Wesley H Leach] place, he is now Capt of
        Company &quot;A&quot; -- There are few who are doin as
        wel as I am and I have friends on every hand. Pay is the
        same as 2</strong><sup><strong>nd</strong></sup><strong>
        Lt. With the addition of $10 extra as Com&#146;d&#146;r
        of Company. I was not expecting another honor so soon and
        it took me entirely by surprise. I do not like to take so
        much responsibility but can do it, if I must. I have a
        good lot of boys. I will get along without any trouble.</strong></p>
        <p><strong>I have not been well the past week, was taken
        with chills and fever and fearing it would end in a
        regular course of fever, I took a heavy dose of Calomel
        and now I have a sore mouth. It is much better than it
        was and I feel better myself, shall soon be as well as
        ever again.</strong></p>
        <p><strong>The Brigade and Regt are but out on a five day
        scout. I was not well and therefore did not go. It is the
        first one I have missed in a long time.</strong></p>

        law and the prosecution of the war. I cannot believe are
        opposed to either altho claiming to be a Democrat.</strong></p>
        <p><strong>I tell you the men in the army are death on
        the Copperheads. By these I mean men who are opposed to
        every move of the government and are crying for peace and
        compromise. What Peace can we have? What Compromise can
        we make? We can have peace by recognizing them as a
        government. We can have compromise with them in no other
        way and then they will claim Ky and Tenn are the people
        searching for such a peace as this would be? Are they
        satisfied with such terms?</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Then why not rise in union and crush them out.
        </strong></p>
        <p><strong>Is this the time to argue about politics?
        Verily; no! The business of the North should be to stop
        their traitorous mouths and let not another work go in
        the hungry ears ot the South and to send us more ment.
        They can hold out not much longer, I believe things are
        approaching a crisis already and ere long the affair will
        be solved. &#150; Right will triumph.</strong></p>

        Apr 14</strong><sup><strong>th</strong></sup><strong>
        1863</strong><p><strong>Dear ones all</strong></p>
        <p><strong>I re&#146;c&#146;d a letter from hom to night.
        We just came in from a scout. Have been out since last
        Thursday morning. Our Brigade has not done much. We were
        over near Franklin. Van Dorn is hovering around to see
        what he may devour. He made a dash into Franklin on
        Friday. But got rather severely handled. We killed about
        on hundred, officers and all, while our loss was but a
        trifle compared to theirs. The Fourth Regulars captured a
        Battery of six pieces but they were not supported and
        consequently were obliged to give it up again. Although
        they succeeded in disabling a part of it by cutting the
        spokes in the wheels.</strong></p>
        <p><strong>I am feeling firstrate again. I got a letter
        from John Gilbert also today. He gets along slowly.
        I&#146;m afraid he does not have as good treatment as he
        should , would like to go him but cannot at present. He
        has a good appetite, but can&#146;t get enough to allay
        it.</strong></p>
        <p><strong>We have had several nice showers &amp; the
        woods are beginning to look quite green. Apple and Plums
        trees are in blossom. The fields of wheat and grass are
        starting up. And all nature is looking pretty. You well
        see the negro women out in the field planting corn and
        holding plow. I&#146;ve got used to it all here but it
        would seem odd at home.</strong></p>
        <p><strong>I am sorry to hear that Ovid is so far gone.
        Although I think the Democrats of Ovid are generally
        loyal and vote accordingly. They still cling to the old
        ship &quot;Democracy&quot; not knowing seemingly how
        rotten a hulk she now is. They seem to think that the
        NAME is sufficient to carry them safely through &#150;
        but after having been afflicted with a dry rot ever since
        1850. And running into the old ship Constitution at
        Charleston, thereby losing the most of their important
        machinery and causing such a leak, That ever since they
        have been going down. I should think the passengers would
        be getting uneasy and want to take passage in a safer
        boat. Such a one for instance as the &quot;Liberty
        Union&quot; a double decker capable of carrying more than
        any other boat in the world. And sailing the fastest with
        or against the current. Passengers on board this boat
        have confidence in their pilot as his compass never fails
        and they are certain of reaching their destination sooner
        than any other boat for they have taken the nearest
        route. Consequently they have no reason to argue among
        themselves or to find fault with others who are doing
        better than they can do.</strong></p>
        <p><strong>I would like to have seen H C Smith elected as
        Supervisor and John Gilbert a justice, they deserve it.
        They are unconditional Union Men. Wm Shepard is not safe
        he is running fast but he is in a wheelbarrow runing on
        the planks of the treacherous ship &quot;Democracy.&quot;</strong></p>
        <p><strong>I am sorry you can&#146;t send a box. I had
        got my mouth fixed for Maple Sugar. Hiram Knowles is
        getting better. Alf Shepard also Billy Egleston is tough
        as ever. Lorenzo is now first Sergeant of Co
        &quot;B.&quot; I commenced on nothing and am now spun
        out. Write often. My love to all my friends. Tell Frank
        Shepard to write me a letter.</strong></p>

        <p><strong>I rec&#146;d your letter today acknowledging
        the reciept of the likenesses. Glad to hear from you. Ben
        Shepard is not worth a decent man&#146;s notice and he
        makes such remarks. I don&#146;t care what he or any of
        that stripe say about me they can&#146;t hurt me. Their
        ravings cannot be helped. The expressions they get off
        about me is but the scum and foam from the large amount
        of Copper and Malicious Jealousy, mixed together of which
        they are mostly made up.</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Mrs Longcor need not be alarmed about my boy
        Ed&#146;s coming up north. I sent his likeness up to you
        more for the novelty of the thing than anything else.
        &#150; Thought it would amuse you. &#150; but if I should
        bring him &#150; Yes! Suppose I should commit such an
        awful act, whose business would it be but my own! -- I
        don&#146;t believe I think more of the negro, than Mrs
        Longcor -- but I do believe and say they ought to have
        their freedom and they shall have it &#150; not only
        because they are human and have souls, but because their
        masters have forfeited all right to them and their loss
        is our gain &#150; And again they make good soldiers,
        good Fighting soldiers, and I say let them fight. They
        are no better to stop a ball than I am --- If working men
        are so opposed to arming the negro let them take the
        musket out of their hands and come along.</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Show one a man, who is down on our negro
        soldiers and who keeps hanging back and shirking and I
        will show you a coward. Yes a moral coward and I believe
        God hates a coward. </strong></p>
        <p><strong>I am expecting some photographs, soon, I will
        send you one when they come. We have a very pretty camp
        here. Know nothing of the prospects of moving at all.</strong></p>

        Starkey and how many since I left Ovid. &#150; of those

        Sunday Apr 20</strong><sup><strong>th</strong></sup><strong>
        1863</strong><p><strong>Dear Folks</strong></p>
        <p><strong>I must write and tell you that I am well
        although nothing else of interest presents itself. I Have
        rec&#146;d no letters from home in some time. None I
        believe recognizing my promotion and change to another
        company. The regiment has been out since last Monday. I
        was about half-sick then and did not go, but I feel all
        right now and am having a long rest with nothing else to
        do but write or read.</strong></p>
        <p><strong>I enjoy myself firstrate have a wall tent all
        to myself. Good bunk etc. and I am living well too. Good
        bread and butter ham potatoes onions tea and coffee. And
        we get mackerel for supper sometimes which is very nice.</strong></p>
        <p><strong>I have not been mustered yet as an officer and
        have only rec&#146;d pay up to Dec 31. As I was mustered
        in the payrolls before I had really rec&#146;d my
        commission. They refuse to pay me. But as soon as I am
        mustered as an officer I will get my Discharge papers as
        an enlisted man and draw pay on thru up to the date of
        discharge. Which will be up to the 6</strong><sup><strong>th</strong></sup><strong>
        of April as I rec&#146;d my commission as 2</strong><sup><strong>nd</strong></sup><strong>
        Lt as that day. I also got my 1</strong><sup><strong>st</strong></sup><strong>
        Lieut&#146;s on Apr 15</strong><sup><strong>th</strong></sup><strong>
        after I mustered and have no need for them I will send
        them home and you may have them framed if you like. [I
        believe he is talking of his Commission Papers-MR] </strong></p>
        <p><strong>Our fine weather still continues. The trees
        are newly leaved and grass has quite a start.</strong></p>
        <p><strong>I sent you a Nashville Union some time ago.
        There is a letter in ti that will perhaps prove
        interesting. I have also written to the Clinton Paper and
        sent them some exchanges. The copperheads get a slight
        touch, but not as much as they deserve. You may be
        assured they have no sympathy here. The Traitors! And if
        they forcibly try to miss the conscript in any other
        legal law they will bitterly see the day. &#150; If they
        have a spark of Patriotism left they had better at once
        enlist to save their now doubted loyalty and honor. There
        is no use of their trying to oppose the great fact that
        this Union will be preserved and that the Sacred
        Constitution will suffer if it is not actually destroyed
        and the more they oppose this fact the more will they be
        left out in the COLD. I can see it plainly.</strong></p>
        <p><strong>I just rec&#146;d your letter Amelia, and was
        glad to hear of your health, but was pained to hear of
        the loss in George&#146;s family. I sympathize with them
        sincerely. They think so much of their children and I am
        also very sorry to hear of Aaron&#146;s death. He was
        always apparently hearty He was a good hearted boy and I
        am glad of the protracted meeting. I hope it will do much
        good. I would like to be at her school house and hear a
        good sermon and see all of my friends, It would be a
        Pleasure.</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Aunt Nep is very foolish. I hate to hear a
        woman talk so. I supposed she had more faith in the
        People. She seems to think the whole country is utterly
        depraved. Entirely sinful. She is mistaken and is getting
        to be a real croaker. Don&#146;t tell her so, for
        pity&#146;s sake.</strong></p>
        <p><strong>I will look for the Box now soon. Hiram is
        getting better. Billy is well as ever. As soon as the Col
        gets back I am going to try and see John. From what I
        hear and he writes he is not getting along very well.</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Give my love to all. Sam, you must write, tell
        Hiram and Mary Longcor, I don&#146;t like them at all
        because they don&#146;t write</strong></p>

        did not know he was so bad, he is a skeleton. He may

        for any, in the company muster roll it shows that I have
        been mustered as an enlisted man, it is in Detroit. It
        has been sent for. I just got a letter from Ben the folks
        are all well. I will write to him this day.</font></p>
        <p><font size="4">Our camp looks very nice. We have rows
        of cedar trees set out between the tents and around my

        tent poles are twined with a wreath of cedars, you know I
        like to be fixing such things. My quarters are as nice as
        any of the officers and as clean. I had no news to write
        today, just wrote to let you know I was well. Mother, I

        moved our camp farther from town in a nice piece of
        woods, cool and shady. We call it &#145;Park&#146; Camp
        and like the name it is appropriate, it is a park and we
        like to Honor our Col that soon will be [Josiah B Park,
        Ovid, mustered as Lt Col May 23, 1863].</font></p>
        <p><font size="4">I am telling you the same old story. My
        continued good health, but you don&#146;t get sick of it
        do you? It is a good story. I hope I may always hear the
        same from home and be able to write it every time&#133;.
        But with my health I must tell you of death. Hiram
        Knowles is gone! He died Tuesday morning &#133;. So we
        pass along! Consumption was his disease as near as I
        could judge. I visited him last week. He looked very bad.
        Coughed and ??ed a good deal and was weak. His discharge
        papers were made out some time ago and forwarded, but
        nothing has been heard of them since. He won&#146;t need
        them Now. He was anxious about them when I saw him. Spoke
        of home and did not seem to think he was going to die. I
        could not bear to tell him. He was worried about the ??.
        I told him it would be all right and not to worry and not
        to be uneasy. I shook hands with him and said Good Bye
        &#133; I knew it would be the last time. But He did not. </font></p>
        <p><font size="4">Father,<br>
        He spoke about buying his lot. I wrote to you about it.
        You can use your own judgment. I hardly believe we want
        it. Do as you think best&#133;..</font></p>
        <p><font size="4">I will see that his business is
        arranged as much as I can. I will speak to Lieut. Carter
        [Julius M Carter, Ovid] about it. He has not drawn much
        pay. I don&#146;t know how much is due him - quite an
        amount.</font></p>
        <p><font size="4">I have to borrow all the money I use. I
        have not been mustered. I have Pay due me from Dec 31 and
        Lieut&#146;s pay from Apr 6<sup>th</sup>. I have bought
        me a new sash, $10.00 and a new Dress Coat and Straps. I
        have not got a Bill of that yet about $35, I expect.</font></p>
        <p><font size="4">I was out on Picket last Sunday and had
        quite a little adventure. Captured 3 Rebels and their
        Horses and Saddles and arms complete. Quite a feather in
        MY cap&#133;. Several of the rebs had been seen for 2 or
        3 days back, on the road in front and they nearly all
        stopped at a home about a mile beyond my videttes. I
        thought perhaps I could nab them, so I took a Relief,
        mounted, and went to our outpost a little before
        Daylight. I then dismounted tied my horse and had seven
        of my men do the same, ordering the remainder to come to
        our support if they heard firing. We went down cautiously
        to the house. I sent a man to the left and right of the
        road, for you know, we were outside of our lines and did
        not know what we would come across. We got to the house
        about daylight, surrounded it. No one there, but , the
        owners, strong old sesesh, Alexander by name. Presently
        we saw 3 horsemen come up the road. We secreted ourselves
        so that if they came to the house we could surround them.
        They came on, my men ran out in the road in the rear of
        them &#150; cried surrender. One of them, who had had his
        gun in his hand all the time, raised it as if to shoot.
        When quicker than thought my boys fired. One ball struck
        his hip and came out just below his belt in abdomen.
        Another one struck his wrist another one struck his
        horse. I hollered at the men to stop firing or they would
        have killed him. I felt sorry for him, smart good
        looking, if he had not raised his gun the boys would not
        have fired. He died in a day or two. I expected the
        firing would draw more of them upon us and when the
        ambulance came, I took 20 men with me and went down. But
        no one came in sight. Since then they have kept a ?fire
        there all the time.</font></p>

        graze, besides the oats and corn they get. We are ready
        to move at a moment&#146;s warning, but there are no
        signs of it at present. Our position in Virginia is not

        Camp Park, June 17/63<br>
        Dear Father<br>
        We just got in from our 6 days scout and it has been a
        hard one -- I tell you. We did not start until about 3 pm
        and went to Lebanon 28 miles distant that night. We
        traveled out six miles from town where we halted and fed.
        We had heard from our scouts in that direction that there
        was about 1000 or the rebels at Lebanon and we intended
        to clean them out. On dismounting, when we halted, one of
        the 5th Iowa boys was almost instantly killed by his
        comrade next to him. His Carbine caught in some manner on
        the saddle or stirrups and went off. The ball passing
        thro&#146; his left lung and out on right side cutting
        one of the large arteries. Poor Fellow! He never spoke.
        One cannot be too cautions. I would hate to be killed by
        my friend or by myself.<br>
        After feeding at about ten o&#146;clock we started again.
        We had about 1500 all told. We had a passable road and
        went along pretty good jog. Got into Lebanon just
        daylight. No rebels there. All went away last night was
        what the citizens told us. Went off on the Alexandria
        Pike. It is a mystery to me how they get their
        information for they heard of our coming even before we
        knew where we were going ourselves, for we never know
        where we are going until we move. But they did. We
        followed after them on the Alexandria Pike &#150; came
        upon their near guards about 11am had a little skirmish
        in which one to the 4th regulars was killed. Then went
        back a short distance and fed our horses, gave them wheat
        in bundle about noon we started again.<br>
        It was a very hot day and our poor horses were tired in
        the forenoon our Reg&#146;t was on the left as
        skirmishers and the ground was very rough, stony and
        hilly. We moved cautiously skirmishing all the way about
        six miles into a nice valley with good feed and the Col
        concluded to stay there all night.<br>
        We had orders to move only to Lebanon and our coming any
        farther was at our own risk. Well, we posted our pickets
        in front and in the right and left strongly and were
        settling down to rest when Bang! Bang! Came their
        artillery from a hill. Our pickets rushed in letting us
        [know?] there was<br>
        quite a force in front with 5 pieces of artillery. They
        were mountain howitzers I tho&#146;t by the sound. We
        immediately formed and went out to see what was there,
        but they had run back again and it was growing dark. The
        Col had also learned that they were about 4000 strong
        with artillery at Alexandria and so of course it would
        not be prudent to move after them and their demonstration
        in front was only to divert our attention while they were
        trying to FLANK US on BOTH SIDES. So we moved back after
        calling in our pickets by a cross road and an ugly one
        too. Baird&#146;s Mill on the Lebanon Pike 21 miles from
        Murfreesboro. Got there 3 ½ am this morning as tired a
        lot as you ever saw -- not a wink of sleep had we. I
        never was so sleepy in my life and when we got to the
        Mill I just lopped down on the<br>
        ground and slept about two hours as sound as a log. When
        we moved on and got into camp about 3pm tired and
        dusty--- Wheat is ripe, partly cut, corn is growing very
        fast. I saw some drawing<br>

        and a Union family that the rebels, about 600 strong,
        under Colonel Duke,<br>
        had left Lebanon at about 5 p. m., the 15th, by the
        Sparte (or Alexandria)<br>
        road. I immediately followed them to Spring Creek, 5
        miles out, watered the<br>
        horses, and dismounted to feed, when the rebels attacked
        my pickets from<br>
        toward Alexandria, driving them in, and following them
        sharply with about<br>
        300 men, mounted and dismounted. I sent
        Lieutenant-Colonel Sipes, with the<br>
        Seventh Pennsylvania, to the right, and Major Mix, with
        the Fourth<br>
        Michigan, to the left (directing them to keep a little in
        advance of the<br>
        head of the column on the pike), the Fourth Regulars on
        the pike, the Fifth<br>
        Iowa in reserve, and the battalion Third Indiana guarding
        the ambulances.<br>
        My advance was necessarily slow, in consequence of the
        rough nature of the<br>
        ground over which the flanking columns had to pass. The
        rebels retired<br>
        slowly, fighting stubbornly, until near Shop Spring,
        where the advance of<br>
        the Fourth Regulars, under Lieutenant O'Connell, charged
        and drove them<br>
        from the fences, from behind which they had been
        fighting. Our horses were<br>
        tired, and those of the enemy apparently fresh, so that
        the only result was<br>
        to drive them. Having now arrived at the junction of the
        cross-road leading<br>
        to Baird's Mills, which gave me a good line of retreat, I
        took a position<br>
        on the right side of the road, to allow the men to get
        their breakfasts.<br>
        Unfortunately, there was no feed to be had for the
        horses.</font></p>
        <p><font size="4">At 11.30, I again moved forward, the
        Seventh Pennsylvania in advance,<br>
        followed by the Fourth Michigan, Third Indiana, and
        Fourth Regulars, the<br>
        Fifth Iowa on the flanks. We drove the enemy as before.
        At about 2 o'clock<br>
        I arrived at Watters' Mill, halted the column, and sent
        Colonel Sipes, with<br>
        the Seventh Pennsylvania and two companies of the Fifth
        Iowa, 2 miles to<br>
        the front; threw out strong pickets 1 1/2 miles in every
        direction, and fed<br>
        horses.</font></p>
        <p><font size="4">At Lebanon, and at all points along the
        road, I received information that<br>
        Morgan was at Alexandria with 4,000 men and from six to
        twelve pieces of<br>
        artillery. When Colonel Sipes returned he brought
        confirmation of these<br>
        reports. Skirmishing was kept up with my pickets on the
        Alexandria road it<br>
        intervals all the afternoon. At 7 p. m. a courier came in
        from the front,<br>
        reporting that the enemy was advancing in force, and
        immediately after they<br>
        opened fire with their artillery. I sent the parties from
        both the right<br>
        and left reported that a heavy column was moving down
        each flank. I<br>
        immediately doubled my pickets, and remained in position
        until 9 o'clock,<br>
        when I fell back, taking the crossroad from Shop Spring
        to Baird's Mills,<br>
        at which place I arrived at 2.30 a. m. without
        molestation.</font></p>
        <p><font size="4">Up to this time we had marched 56
        miles. Some of the men had had one hour's<br>
        sleep, and the others no sleep whatever. At 6.30 I
        resumed the march for<br>
        Murfreesborough, arriving at Stone's River at 10 o'clock.
        I halted for a<br>
        couple of hours to rest the horses, and then returned to
        camp. Captain<br>
        Davis, Seventh Pennsylvania, who commanded the rear guard
        from Baird's<br>
        Mills, reports that a strong force of the enemy came into
        that place from<br>
        toward Lebanon as he was leaving it, but attempted
        nothing further than an<br>
        exchange of shots.</font></p>
        <p><font size="4">If I hand a couple of pieces of
        artillery, John [H.] Morgan should either<br>
        have given me battle or Alexandria; but without them, I
        felt that I would<br>
        be fighting at too great a disadvantage and uselessly
        sacrificing the lives<br>
        of my men. I therefore considered it my duty to retire.<br>
        I am, respectfully, your obedient servant,<br>
        ROBT. H. G. MINTY,<br>
        Colonel, Commanding.</font></p>

        You are doubtless anxious to hear from me and perhaps
        uneasy for fear of my safety. At last we are encamped but
        for how long I cannot tell. We have been constantly on
        the move since June 24th. The day the army moved from
        Murfreesboro. I am well as usual excepting a bad cold,
        but am feeling well at heart. When I wrote you last I was
        at Murfreesboro in hosp. I was there about one week. My
        poison is cured We are about ten miles from Winchester
        near the Fayetteville branch of the Nashville and
        Chattanooga RR The cars run down to Descherd&#146;s
        Station about 12 miles from here and I understand there
        are no obstructions as far as Bridgeport. Our Brigade has
        been to Huntsville, Alabama. Just came back this week.
        There are no rebels this side of the Tennessee River
        excepting a few guerrillas in the mountains. They dare
        not show themselves. Centerville is the prettiest place I
        have seen in the South. The news we are getting daily is
        most Encouraging I have had read since the war commenced,
        for a speedy termination. Vicksburg and Fort Hudson are
        ours giving us clear sweep of the great River and loosing
        our large army there. I believe by this time Jackson is
        ours and General Johnson is whipped &#150; at Charleston
        we are doing nobly. We will take the place no doubt.
        Bragg we know nothing about, He has, I think, divided his
        Army and Morgan is reported captured, while Lee&#146;s
        army is very much demoralized. The army here is highly
        excited over the good news. Our star is in the ascendant
        again. There is a rumor here that Jeff Davis is dead but
        whether so or not can&#146;t tell. The old scamp would
        die, it might save him much disgrace and humiliation and
        a blessing to the distracted Country. I have rec&#146;d
        the likeness at last - they are very good. I must close.
        Write some. I rec&#146;d yours of the 13th. I will write
        oftener now. Yours affectionately Albert</b></font></p>

        Dear Sir<br>
        This is a cold wintry uncomfortable Autumn day and I feel
        ill-natured but I am going to scratch off a line to you,
        for it has been a long time since you have heard from me
        - or I from you. I wrote a letter to John [John N
        Gilbert, Ovid, Mich] the other day and one to father[
        Edward Coke Potter]. They are the only two I have written
        this Month. My Health has been excellent except for two
        or three days last week I caught cold but feel better
        now. We have had a very different Fall from what we had
        last. It has been cold cloudy, windy and rainy mostly all
        the<br>
        month - decidedly uncomfortable. The brigade has not seen
        a wagon or piece of a train since it left Washington,
        East Tennessee Sept 30, 1863 to chase old Wheeler day and
        night from that place to Pikeville in the Sequatchee
        Valley, to McMinnville, to Murfreesboro, to Shelbyville,
        Lewisburg, Pulaski from there to the Tennessee river at
        Lamb&#146;s Jenny 3 miles above Muscle<br>
        Shoals where they got away from us. I rather think they
        got worsted. We captured mostly all their artillery and
        took about 600 prisoners and killed. I have not seen a
        clean shirt or pr of drawers or socks since the 30th ult.
