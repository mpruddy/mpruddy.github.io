<strong>Background:</strong><br>
<br>
<strong>These letters were written by several brothers, William
Smith, Lenard Smith, James Byers Smith, Hugh Alexander Smith,
Conner Smith and Osburn Smith. They were born in Lincoln County,
Tennessee where their grandfather settled after serving the
infant American Army during the revolution. When the War between
the States began they were aged 25, 23, 19, 16, 15 and 13
respectively. They enlisted in the Confederate Army in October,
1861. As was normal for men from the locale, they all served in
the 32nd Tennessee Infantry Regiment.<br>
<br>
Hugh Alexander Smith was killed in the second day's fighting at
Chickamauga, September 20, 1863. William Smith was wounded in the
face at Missionary Ridge, November 25, 1863. He was last reported
in hospital at Macon, Georgia, July 17, 1864. Lenard Smith was
wounded at Resaca, Georgia, May 15, 1864 and &quot;captured by
the enemy.&quot; I have found no further record of him. The
service records for Conner Smith have thus far not been found.
James Byers Smith served the entire war without a scratch and was
one of only 16 men present at the regiment's surrender in 1865.
Osburn Smith was apparently sent home &quot;to grow up&quot; and
survived the war.<br>
<br>
The War between the States is full of ironies and complexities.
One is the survival of these letters. They were carried from the
Confederate Army to Taft, Tennessee by a slave,
&quot;Henery.&quot; Henery would then return carrying food,
letters and news. Several of these trips crossed Union lines.
Henery certainly could have disappeared on any of these trips.
His individual loyalty, courage and integrity can only be
appreciated by understanding that he too shared the suffering of
his masters in the Confederate Army. Should any of Henery's
descendants read this, I ask that they contact me. I will greet
them as family.<br>
<br>
<br>
After delivery, these letters were kept by their mother, Ginsey
Smith, until her death. They were then kept by a sister, Sarah A.
Smith. Like many southern women, she never married after her
fiancee was killed in the war. Instead, she raised and cared for
the rest of the family. In the 1920's James Byers Smith returned
to Tennessee to care for Sarah during her last illness. He
returned to Texas with the letters where they have been handed
down in the family.<br>
<br>
After the war, James Byers Smith returned to Taft, Tennessee to
find that the family had little left. In the reconstruction
south, he sold what could not be carried including his land and
mule. His new wife and young children came down the Mississippi
River to New Orleans and from there to Indianola, Texas. They
walked to near Gonzales, Texas where he tried to buy land. In an
experience repeated across the south, corrupt
&quot;carpetbaggers&quot; first &quot;sold&quot; the land and
then sued and recovered the land, crops and improvements when
they were not paid in hard cash.<br>
<br>
The family finally settled in what is now Oak Hill, Travis
County, Texas (now Austin) where he cleared and farmed the land
where the Motorola plant now stands. As his children grew up, he
sold the land and moved to near 24th and Red River Streets in
Austin so that his children could walk to the University of
Texas. They were some of the first students to graduate as
longhorns. Many descendants have remained in Austin.</strong></p>
