Below is the story of Sgt. George Bullard's participation in the
War Between the States. This is a copy of his original memoirs.<br>
June 6, 1896<br>
<br>
&quot;It may be of interest to many, especially my relatives and
members of Company E, 4th Michigan Cavalry1, to know that I
survived that long-to-be-remembered rebellion from '61 to '65 but
am still living at the age of fifty-six. It would be folly for me
to attempt to narrate all I saw and passed through in those awful
days, to say nothing of the suffering, both mentally and
physically, mostly the former. For I carry no scars to remind me
of a saber stroke over the head which was the only wound I
received. However, I will name a few of the battles in which I
took part and which are still vividly pictured in horrible
outline before me.<br>
<br>
Enlisted at Owosso, Michigan, August 9, 1862, as member of
Company E, 4th Michigan Cavalry. I first smelled smoke, heard the
whine of bullets and heard the blood curdled groans of the
wounded and dying at Perryville. Next battle was at Munfordville.
Skirmished through the following Tennessee towns: Lebanon,
LaVergne, Spring Hill, Franklin, Sparta, McMinnville, Tullahoma,
Scorcher Valley, Columbia, Shelbyville, Tunnell Hill and
Chickamauga and on to Ringgold, GA. Covering this territory many
times, first in one State then another. Of course, I do not give
these engagements in order, only naming them that you may see
some of the battles I was in.<br>
<br>
I was also in the battle of Stone River where I was captured for
the first and only time during the whole siege. <br>
<br>
I was dashing back with a message from our commander to the
infantry about a half mile distance to bring up a piece of
artillery, when I was surprised by Confederate scouts disguised
in Union Uniforms. Thinking them my own men I rode straight into
their hands. I was ordered to halt, but thinking they had no
business to halt me I kept on going. I was shot at and missed.
Reaching the squad I was struck over the head with a saber,
drawing blood. Oh yes, I stopped then! <br>
<br>
Our own men, discovering their identity, began shelling us and
all made for the river, I being a willing guest, for it was
getting warm for us. The captain rode straight into the river,
disappearing for an instant, for the water was at least ten feet
deep. The rest following, I taking a bath with them. It was a
sight, for every horse touched bottom. My horse rolled back with
me in attempting to go up the opposite bank and I thought I was
gone. Managed to free myself, however, and got out. It was so
cold our clothes froze to us. <br>
<br>
To make a long story short, I was kept a prisoner at Chattanooga
with about 2200 others several days, finally landing in Libby
prison. The horror of horrors of which all have heard and
possibly many of whom who read this will remember from
experience. Thirty eight days from capture I was paroled and sent
Annapolis, MD, thence to Camp Chase, Ohio and then exchanged and
rejoined my regiment at Murfreesboro, TN.<br>
<br>
Near Kingston, GA, four companies of our regiment were sent out
to reconnoiter and rode into a trap laid by the enemy. They were
formed in shape of horseshoe and we rode into the opening, when
they opened on us from all sides. My horse was shot and covered
with blood which gushed from his neck. I took to the brush.
Crawling behind a log close by a small stream I lay for at least
two hours, before I dared attempt to get out and reach my
company. <br>
<br>
Here a laughable thing occurred which shows even in the jaws of
death it is a temptation to play a prank, at least for some of
us, for I always was on the lookout for funny things and am yet. <br>
<br>
Creeping from behind a log and crawling through the brush, I
discovered a loose horse close by and was about to get him when I
saw nearby John Nelson of &quot;K&quot; company in a stooping
position peering ahead. I crawled up and slapped him on the back.
He liked to have jumped out of his boots and I remember his exact
words when he saw who I was. The were &quot;Sergeant, get down,
don't you see the Rebs right in front?&quot; The passed not forty
yards from us. We then reached our regiment in safety. Before
leaving this point will say that we lost twenty six men here
which will show what a hot fight it was.<br>
<br>
I Will not tire you with more, with exception of my part in
capture of Jefferson Davis.<br>
<br>
The last duty I performed was at the capture of Jefferson Davis
and his escort. Brother Silas and myself were two of the fourteen
picked men for the advance column of 128 men. I being a sergeant
was in the advance. Just before reaching Irvinsville, GA, I
pressed an old Negro into service to plot us to the camp then let
him go back. We then waited for the dawn of day. They were soon
astir preparing for an early start - we were then within forty
rods of them. Captain Hudson in command of the advance was the
first man into the camp. Sergeant G. A. Bullard (myself) was
second. Silas Bullard was in the first set of fours close up. <br>
<br>
They were completely surprised and offered no resistance.
Unfortunately for us, it not being good daylight, the First
Wisconsin Cavalry coming from the opposite direction opened fire
on us. We had a hot skirmish and got all mixed up before we found
out our mistake. Two of our men were killed, one of them John
Hines of my company. After going through the whole war, to be
killed at the last moment. It was a sad scene for us all. <br>
<br>
I was mustered out of the service at Nashville, TN, went north
and lived three years there, coming south to Columbia, TN, where
I engaged in the boot and shoe business until a year ago. I quit
on account of poor health.&quot;<br>
<br>
<br>
George A. Bullard was born January 25, 1842 in Oakland, Michigan.
He and his younger brother Silas Bullard both joined the 4th
Michigan Cavalry. After the war, he moved to Columbia, TN where
he married Sarah Gill. He died April 27, 1911 and was buried in
Columbia, TN.<br>
