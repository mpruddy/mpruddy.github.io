<p align="center"><font size="4"><strong>CIVIL WAR DRAFT RECORDS</strong></font></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><font size="3"><strong>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The first national draft in U.S.
history was authorized by President Lincoln when he signed the
Enrollment Act on March 3, 1863.&nbsp; It was created to provide&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;more men to fight for the Union in the Civil War.&nbsp; After the
first year or two of the war, the number of volunteers dwindled
almost to the vanishing point.&nbsp; Under&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; the new draft bill,
all eligible males between the ages of 20 and 45, both white
citizens and aliens, who had declared their intent to naturalize,
were eligible for the&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;draft.&nbsp; </strong></font></p>

<p><font size="3"><strong>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Males 20 to 45 were to be drafted
first, followed by all married men between the ages of 36 to
46.&nbsp; Males 17 to 20 could serve with the permission of a
parent or&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;guardian.&nbsp; The records of the draft include men
born between 1818 and 1843 and include men who did not serve as
well as those who served in the Army during&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;the Civil War.&nbsp;
The draft applied only to men residing in states of the United
States under Union control.</strong></font></p>

<p><font size="3"><strong>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The following drafts were held:<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;15 Jun 1863 100,000 6 months<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;17 Oct 1863 500,000 3 years<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;14 Mar 1864 200,000 3 years<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;23 Apr 1864 85,000 100 days<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;18 Jul 1864 500,000 1, 2, and 3 years<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;19 Dec 1864 300,000 1, 2, and 3 years</strong></font></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><font size="3"><strong>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Originally the bill allowed for few
exemptions, none were based on occupation or religion, but some
based on hardship.&nbsp; Any drafted man could, however, either&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; pay a $3OO commutation fee or provide a substitute to serve in
his place.&nbsp; It was later estimated that 65% of the men
identified in the 1863 draft were released&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; because of physical
disability or hardship.</strong></font></p>

<p><font size="3"><strong>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The draft, which was very unpopular,
would not be applied in any locality that had alreadv met its
quota of recruits.&nbsp; The country was divided into&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Congressional Districts.&nbsp; The need for men was apportioned
to those districts, and each district was supposed to provide a
specified number of men.&nbsp; If that&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; proper number of men had
volunteered in a given district, the draft would not apply
there.&nbsp; So it was in the interest of government authorities
in the counties&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; and cities to recruit men as vigorously as they
could to keep the draft from affecting the people in their
area.&nbsp; The draft stirred recruiting drives all over the&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; country and resulted in a great many men going into the army who
probably would not have enlisted if they were left to their own
devices.</strong></font></p>

<p><font size="3"><strong>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The draft records, available for a time
period in which tracing families is sometimes difficult, are
invaluable for obtaining information on men living in cities or&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; rural areas.&nbsp; The draft records give additional important
details than those found in either the censuses or city
directories.</strong></font></p>

<p><font size="3"><strong>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The existing conscription records
include lists of men which are created by enrollment districts
based upon the Districts of the 38th Congress.&nbsp; </strong></font></p>

<p><font size="3"><strong>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The records are found in National
Archives RG 110 (Records of the Provost Marshal General's Bureau)
and National Archives RG 59 (General Records of the&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Department of
State).&nbsp; The records have not been microfilmed and most are
in bound volumes.&nbsp; It is important to be able to identify
the Congressional District&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; in which the soldier or non-soldier
lived in 1863. </strong></font></p>

<p><font size="3"><strong>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; This is the purpose for the following
index to the Congressional Districts.&nbsp; First, a little more
information about five types of records created by the Draft that&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;are used by genealogist studying their family history.</strong></font></p>

<p><font size="3"><strong>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;1. Consolidated Lists.&nbsp; These are
the most important individual records.&nbsp; </strong></font></p>

<p><font size="3"><strong>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; An entry for a man gives his name;
place of residence; age as of July 1, 1863; occupation; marital
status, state, territory, or country of birth; and the military&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; organization (if a volunteer) of which he previously was a
member.&nbsp; The records are arranged by state and by
Congressional or Enrollment District.&nbsp; Most are&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; bound in
volumes.&nbsp; They are divided into three classes- men between
the ages of 20 and 35 subject to military duty and unmarried men
above 35 and under 45&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; subject to military duty; married men above
35 and under 45; and volunteers.&nbsp; Entries in each class are
arranged in rough alphabetical order by initial letter of&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; surname.&nbsp; To access your ancestor on the consolidated lists,
it is necessary to identify the Congressional District in which
the soldier or non-soldier lived in 1863.</strong></font></p>

  <br>
  </strong><font color="#FF0000"><strong>1. Letter concerning riots
    and conscritption avoidance:<br>
  </strong></font><strong>PENNSYLVANIA EXECUTIVE CHAMBER,<br>
    Harrisburg, Pa., October 25, 1862.<br>
    Hon. E. M. STANTON, <br>
    Secretary of War, Washington, D.C.:<br>
    SIR: The riots in Schuylkill County have ceased for the present.
    The object<br>
    of the rioters seems to have been to prevent the draft, and to
    this end, I<br>
    understand that they forcibly obstructed persons who had been
    drafted and<br>
    were on their way to the place of rendezvous in conformity with
    the notice<br>
    which had been served on them.<br>
    I beg to observe that this enrollment and draft have been made
    under the<br>
    authority of and directly by the United States. I originally
    suggested,<br>
    therefore, that they should be conducted by officers of the
    United States,<br>
    but that suggestion not being adopted, I have acted for the
    United States<br>
    in superintending the enrollment and the drawing of names for the
    quota.<br>
    The next step contemplated by the regulations is the appointment
    of<br>
    provost-marshals to enforce the attendance of the drafted men. I
    have not<br>
    nominated persons to fill this office, because I do not perceive
    that<br>
    officers of that kind are necessary.<br>
    By the act of 29th of June, 1861, penalties are provided for
    drafted men<br>
    who shall not obey the orders of the President, but there is no
    act<br>
    authorizing them to be forcibly impressed. <br>
    I would advise that a regulation be made directing that the
    courtsmartial<br>
    shall be immediately held on all recusants. These courts must be
    ordered by<br>
    the President.<br>
    In this mode I think you would get the men more easily than by
    the use of<br>
    force. Men unwilling to go, and unable to pay the probable fine,
    will serve<br>
    in the army on pay [in preference] to being shut up in prison
    without pay.<br>
    Those who are able to pay the fine will prefer using the money in
    procuring<br>
    substitutes. The same limit of the fine will probably regulate
    the price of<br>
    substitutes. I respectfully submit these matters for your
    consideration.<br>
    Very respectfully, yours, &amp;c.,<br>
    A. G. CURTIN, <br>
    [Governor of Pennsylvania.]</strong></p>

Stanton concerning problems with conscription:<br>
</strong></font><strong>HARRISBURG, PA., November 22, 1862.<br>
Hon. E. M. STANTON: <br>
The taking of substitutes has grown worse each day until it has
become a<br>
real evil, and I request authority to stop it entirely. A system
of<br>
brokerage has sprung up, and men of suspicious and disreputable
character<br>
are brought in numbers from the cities of New York, Philadelphia,
and<br>
Baltimore for sale. After receiving their money they desert, and
thus but<br>
few men are added to the old regiments. It is producing very
great<br>
demoralization. Arms have arrived, and their issue will commence.
Fourteen<br>
hundred horses will be issued to-day, and Colonel Gregg will be
at once<br>
prepared to move.<br>

</strong></font><strong>73. The Board shall make an exact and
complete roll of the names of the<br>
persons drafted, and of the order in which they were drawn, so
that the<br>
first drawn may stand first on the said roll, and the second may
stand<br>
second, and so on. The draft shall take place at the headquarters
of the<br>
district. It shall be public and under the direction of the Board
of<br>
Enrollment. The name of each person enrolled shall be placed in a
box to be<br>
provided for the purpose, and the provost-marshal, or some person<br>
designated by him (the drawer to be blindfolded), shall draw
therefrom one<br>
name at a time until the required number is obtained.<br>
74. The exact and complete roll of the names of persons drawn in
the draft<br>
shall be entered by the Board in a book to be kept for that
purpose, ruled<br>
and headed to correspond with the descriptive roll of drafted
men. (Form 34.)<br>
75. The number required to fill the call will be taken from this
roll by<br>
commencing at the first name and taking in order, until the
required number<br>
is obtained, all who are not, by the Board, decided to be
excepted and<br>
exempt under the provisions of the enrollment act.<br>
76. The names of the men thus called into service will be entered
on<br>
&quot;descriptive rolls&quot; (in triplicate), signed by the
Board. One copy of this<br>
roll will be sent to the Provost-Marshal-General direct, one copy
to the<br>
acting assistant provost-marshal-general of the State, and one
will be<br>
retained by the provost-marshal.<br>
77. Certified extracts from this descriptive roll shall be made
in<br>
duplicate by the provost-marshal for every party of drafted men
sent off,<br>
and sent with the party to the officer to whom the party is to be<br>
delivered. One copy is to be retained by this officer, and the
other is to<br>
be returned, with a receipt for the party as delivered to him on
the back.<br>
The returned copy will accompany the provost-marshal's monthly
report to<br>
the Provost-Marshal-General.<br>
78. The Board shall note on the roll book of drafted men, in the
column of<br>
remarks opposite each man's name, the disposition made of
him--whether<br>
called into service and sent to the rendezvous, exempted by the
Board,<br>
replaced by a substitute, commuted for, deserted, or discharged
as not<br>
being required.<br>
79. The substitute whom any drafted person is authorized, by
section 13 of<br>
the enrollment act, to furnish must be presented to the Board of<br>
Enrollment; and it shall be the duty of the Board to examine him
and, if<br>
accepted, to place his name on the book of persons drafted, with<br>
explanatory remarks. His name will then be transcribed on the
descriptive<br>
rolls of men called into service.<br>
80. Certificates of exemption from the draft, by reason of having
provided<br>
a substitute, or having paid commutation money, shall be
furnished by the<br>
Board of Enrollment according to Form 31. A discharge from one
draft<br>
furnishes no exemption from any subsequent draft, except that
when the<br>
person drafted has furnished an acceptable substitute, and has
received a<br>
certificate of discharge from a preceding draft, he shall be held
exempt<br>
from military duty during the time for which he was drafted and
for which<br>
such substitute was furnished.<br>
81. The Board shall furnish a discharge (Form 31) from further
liabilities<br>
under the particular draft to any drafted person who presents a
bona fide<br>
receipt, for the sum announced in orders for the procuration of<br>
substitutes, from the person authorized by the Secretary of War
to receive it.<br>
<br>
</strong><font color="#FF0000"><strong>4. REGULATIONS IN REGARD
TO SUBSTITUTES</strong></font>.<br>
<strong>1. Any person enrolled and drafted may at any time on or
before the time at<br>
which he is ordered to report at a rendezvous obtain, and present
to the<br>
Board of Enrollment of the district in which he resides, a
substitute.<br>
2. The substitute must be in every respect suitable for the
military<br>
service, which shall be determined by the Enrolling Board in the
manner<br>
prescribed for examining recruits.<br>
3. Every substitute, after being examined and approved by the
Enrolling<br>
Board, shall enlist in the service of the United States. (Form
40.) <br>
4. And when he shall have so enlisted and reported to the
provost-marshal<br>
for duty the Board shall give the person who has furnished the
substitute a<br>
certificate of exemption (according to Form 31, in Regulations
for the<br>
Government of the Bureau of the Provost-Marshal-General) setting
forth that<br>
the person is &quot;not properly subject to do military duty
during the time for<br>
which he was drafted * * * by reason of 'having furnished an
acceptable<br>
substitute.'&quot;<br>
5. Every substitute who shall have enlisted and reported to the<br>
provost-marshal shall be held subject to all pains and penalties
for<br>
desertion or other offenses in the same manner as other soldiers,
and the<br>
person who has furnished the substitute shall not be responsible
for the<br>
acts of the substitute committed after he shall have enlisted and
reported<br>
to the provost-marshal for duty, as required in the preceding
paragraph.<br>
6. The Board of Enrollment will give public notice after a draft
has been<br>
made that they will, between such hours on every day, up to the
time when<br>
the drafted men are ordered to report at a rendezvous, hear
propositions<br>
for substitutes and examine persons so offering.<br>
7. All persons who may be drafted and who desire to present
substitutes<br>
shall give notice in writing to the Board of Enrollment that on
such a day<br>
they will present a substitute, giving his name, residence, age,
and<br>
stating whether he is an alien or citizen.<br>
8. The Board of Enrollment shall make the enlistment papers of
substitutes<br>
in triplicate, of which one shall be forwarded to the<br>
Provost-Marshal-General, one to the Adjutant-General of the Army,
and the<br>
other retained among the records of the Enrolling Board.<br>
9. Substitutes, after being enlisted, are to be considered as in
all<br>
respects on the same footing with other soldiers, receiving the
same<br>
bounties, pay, and allowances, and amenable to the same
regulations and<br>
discipline.<br>
10. After all the substitutes have been accepted and enlisted in
a district<br>
the Board of Enrollment will render a statement (according to
Form A) to<br>
the Provost-Marshal-General.<br>

available in regards Substitutes and Conscriptees:<br>
</strong></font><strong>STATE OF PENNSYLVANIA,<br>
OFFICE OF THE SECRETARY OF THE COMMONWEALTH,<br>
Harrisburg, Pa., February 1, 1865.<br>
The SPEAKER OF THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES: <br>
SIR: In reply to the resolution of the House of Representatives
of date<br>
January 30, 1865, requesting me to communicate what disposition
has been<br>
made of the papers relating to the draft made by the United
States<br>
Government in Pennsylvania in 1862, together with such facts in
my<br>
possession in relation thereto as may be of both interest and
value to<br>
parties who put substitutes into the service for three years
pending said<br>
draft, I have the honor to report that the draft of 1862,
although commonly<br>
called the State draft, was made under the provisions of an act
of<br>
Congress, the State acting simply as an agent to designate to the
General<br>
Government suitable persons to execute the law under regulations
made by<br>
the United States authorities.<br>
An assistant adjutant-general was appointed by the General
Government,<br>
under whose immediate supervision the persons thus designated
acted. For<br>
the sake of convenience this officer and his clerks occupied a
room in this<br>
department, and reports from the several counties were made to
him. Such of<br>
the papers as related to compensation were sent to Washington for<br>
adjustment and pay; those relating to the enrollment, draft,
exemption,<br>
substitute, and personal service of the drafted men were left by
the U.S.<br>
officers when the draft was consummated in the room which they
had<br>
occupied. These papers appear to contain, among other things, the
names of<br>
such drafted men as then put in substitutes for three years.<br>
A large number of persons have recently called upon me for
certified<br>
extracts from these records showing that they had been drafted
and had<br>
furnished substitutes for three years, and stating that these
certified<br>
extracts would exempt them from liability to the present draft.
As the<br>
papers belong strictly to the United States and are not in my
official<br>
charge, I have felt compelled to decline giving such
certificates.<br>
That justice might, however, be done to a large number of our
citizens, I<br>
directed that the papers should be carefully gathered together
and<br>
delivered to Maj. R. I. Dodge, the provost-marshal of the State.
They were<br>
retained at his office for a day and then returned with the
statement that<br>
Major Dodge declined having anything to do with them.<br>
If it be true, and I believe it has been the case in former
drafts, that<br>
the General Government will strike from the rolls the names of
men who show<br>
that they have substitutes in service, I think it due to our
people that<br>
they should have the benefit of these records.<br>
This end I had hoped to reach by placing them in the hands of the<br>
provost-marshal of the State, that he might distribute them among
the<br>
several boards of enrollment and then give the local boards,
whose duty it<br>
is to correct the rolls, the proper evidence of the exemptions
due the<br>
people of their respective districts.<br>
Respectfully submitted.<br>
ELI SLIFER, <br>
Secretary of the Commonwealth.[PENNSYLVANIA]<br>

</strong><font color="#FF0000"><strong>6. Here is some
information on Conscription Records to aid in a search:<br>
<br>
</strong></font><strong>Conscription is the compulsory enlistment
of persons to serve in the armed<br>
forces. Also known as the draft, conscription began in the United
States<br>
as a result of the Conscription Act of March 3, 1863, during the
War<br>
Between the States, or Civil War. If you know the state and
county where<br>
your ancestor lived in 1863, you can look up the congressional
district in<br>
the &quot;Congressional Directory for the Second Session of the
Thirty-Eighth<br>
Congress of the United States of America&quot; published by the
U.S. House of<br>
Representatives. Once you know the congressional district, you
can request<br>
that the National Archives staff search for the registration file
for your<br>
ancestor.<br>
<br>
There were two types of records produced as a result of the
Conscription<br>
Act of March 3, 1863: consolidated lists and descriptive rolls.
The<br>
consolidated lists provide the person's name, birth date, state
or country<br>
of birth, place of residence, occupation, and marital status as
of July 1,<br>
1863. The descriptive rolls add a physical description and a
place or<br>
birth to the information found on the consolidated list. These
records<br>
are all maintained in the Provost Marshall General's Bureau. The<br>
conscription and service records for the Civil War are in the
process of<br>
being transcribed in a project sponsored by the National Parks
Service. <br>
