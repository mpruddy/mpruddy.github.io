		<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><font size="4">
		Randalstown is a historic place in the County of Tyrone, and here stands 
		the historic castle of Shawn the Proud—Shawn O'Neill, who paid a visit 
		to Queen Elizabeth in London.</font></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><font size="4">Mr. 
		MacMenamin, whom I went to Randalstown to see that day, stood outside 
		the castle walls with me. “There it is,” said. he, &quot;there is the Irish 
		castle of the great O'Neill, there it is now in the hands of an 
		Englishman, and the title of the O'Neill, the English title of Earl of 
		Tyrone, in possession of an Englishman too.&quot; It was a sad thing for an 
		Irishman to reflect upon: I did not let it occupy my thoughts long. I 
		had work to do, work that tended to drive out the Englishmen from the 
		Irishmen's catalog and lands. So having executed my mission with 
		MacMenamin, I bade him goodby, took the train for Ballymena, went on to 
		Ballymoney, and in Ballymoney took the stage coach that landed me in 
		Ballycastle that evening. I put up at the Antrim arms, and next morning 
		I went in search of my friends.</font></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><font size="4">I was 
		never before in Ballycastle, but I had friends there—Irishmen who are 
		now dead and gone. William Darragh was a schoolmaster, he died some 
		years after in an English prison; I met him in Ballycastle and he 
		introduced too to several others. He could not get many of the men 
		together till Sunday, and I was idle for a couple of days in that town. 
		My name then was Irwin, I think. I was courting a young girl of that 
		name at the time, and traveling through Ulster I went under its 
		protection. This Ballycastle is on the northern coast of Ireland. I 
		traveled by the seashore there, and from its hills I had a view of the 
		hills of Scotland twenty miles away. I got one serious fright In my 
		life, and I got it here. I was walking the strand eastward from 
		Ballycastle toward Scotland. I saw a foot beaten path leading front the 
		strand up the mountain side of Fair Head, and up that path I traveled. I 
		was about half way up the mountain side when I began to slip, and I had 
		to creep upward on my hands and feet. Steeper and steeper grow the 
		ascent before me, and to think of going back to the strand was out of 
		the question; it was easier to go up than to go down. I saw by the marks 
		in the path that those who traveled it had nails in their shoes. I had 
		no nails in my shoes, and could not get any support from my feet in 
		climbing that mountain. Rain had fallen the night before and the way was 
		slippery. I had thoughts of death, and thought it a hard way to die—to 
		roll down that mountain. I took off my shoes and stockings, put them in 
		my pockets, and then, by rooting my toes in the earth and grasping the 
		earth forward with my hands, I managed to get over the steep, slippery 
		passages and reach the top. You may be very sure I did not go back to 
		Ballycastle by the road I came from it. I saw the town, some three or 
		four miles in the distance, and faced for it through the fields, over 
		hedges and ditches. On the top of the mountain is a lake, and going 
		through the heather by that lake I started a hare. I was too tired to 
		run and catch it, but I enjoyed a screech after it, and as I was 
		screeching two or three more hares started out before me. Fair Head, in 
		Antrim, must be a great place for game; the hares are plenty, but the 
		people are few. I saw more hares in that locality than I saw people.</font></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><font size="4">When I 
		got back to the hotel in Ballycastle I found that some English tourists 
		had come in during the day. Sitting at the one table at supper I 
		necessarily got acquainted with them. I was a tourist, too. I 
		recommended them to travel by the sea shore toward Fair Head, and go up 
		the path I had traveled and see the lake on the top of the mountain, and 
		see Scotland over across the water. After supper, punch and tobacco and 
		talk came on the table. The Englishmen were Manchester merchants; one of 
		them was named Ledward, another was named Lord and another was named 
		Fitzgerald.</font></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><font size="4">I said 
		the three were English tourists, but I made a slight mistake there, as 
		Fitzgerald was an Irishman; but in conversation about Ireland and 
		England I found him more English than the English themselves. Ireland 
		and England came on the table. I stood for Ireland and Ireland's rights. 
		Fitzgerald stood for England, and when I bit him hard and hit the 
		English rule in Ireland hard Ledward would grasp me warmly by the haud. 
		Lord was the oldest man of the three; his punch ran out, and he called 
		for another round of punch; the waiter told him that he could get no 
		more, that it was twelve o'clock, and the law did not allow any more 
		drinking after twelve. Hereat the three Englishmen became very vexed 
		that in their hotel—in their house —in their castle, as it were, they 
		could not get a glass of punch after 12 o'clock—why at home in England 
		in any hotel in the country such a monstrous thing as that could not 
		occur. &quot;Now, gentlemen,&quot; said I, &quot;you see that this very condition of 
		things here before you gives force to all I have been saying this 
		evening. You have exceptional laws for Ireland and we Irishmen feel you 
		are governing us as if we were au inferior and a subject people.&quot;Lord 
		and Ledward gave me their addresses in Manchester and asked me to call 
		to see them if I over got there. I expect to make the call yet, but how 
		strange they would feel these days if they saw this copy of the <i>Eagle</i> 
		and read in it that the Irishman they met at McDonnell's hotel in 
		Ballycastle in 1864 was that &quot;dynamite fiend,&quot; O'Donovan Rossa.</font></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><font size="4">
		Fitzgerald that night reminded me of a great many other Irishmen who 
		live in Ireland and America; he was a repealer in his young days in 
		Ireland, and he boasted of his patriotism going so far as to have 
		equipped himself with repeal buttons. “Gentlemen,&quot; said I, addressing 
		Lord and Ledward, &quot;you are thoroughbred Englishmen, and no matter how 
		great the intimacy and friendship between you and your friend, Mr. 
		Fitzgerald, may be, you must be inwardly smiling now at his simplicity 
		in thinking he was going to fight England out of the possession of 
		Ireland by dressing himself in green clothes and brass buttons. It is by 
		fight England has gained a foothold in Ireland, and she will fight hard 
		to maintain that foothold; unless Irishmen are determined to fight 
		against her with sword and gun, it is arrant nonsense for them to be 
		talking or singing of having their country great, glorious and free.&quot; I 
		made friends of the Englishmen, but the Irishman was pouting at what I 
		said. They left the hotel next morning to visit the Giant's Causeway 
		some twelve miles distant, they wanted me right or wrong to travel with 
		them, but my time in the town was not up till Sunday.</font></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><font size="4">On 
		Saturday I walked along the coast a few miles toward Rathlin Island and 
		the Giant's Causeway, and on my return passing a house, I heard behind 
		me the words 'Hallo, that's O'Donovan Rossa.&quot; I did not look behind. 
		When I got to Ballycastle I met William Darragh and told him I was 
		recognized by some one in such and such a house up the road; he set a 
		reliable man to work to find out who recognized me, and he learned it 
		was a doctor from Dublin who had married one of the family, and was up 
		on a visit. I felt no uneasiness at being recognized anywhere; I had my 
		legitimate business as traveler for the Irish People newspaper, and the 
		business that was illegitimate was a private affair between myself and 
		the friends I trusted.</font></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><font size="4">Sunday 
		passed off in Ballycastle in company with those friends. Several of them 
		came a distance of nine and tea miles from Cushenden and Cushendall and 
		other places among the mountains. I transacted ray business with them, 
		and set out for Derry next morning. I passed Portrush, where tourists 
		stop off to visit the Giant's Causeway, but my tour was not a 
		sightseeing one, and I passed that celebrated place without getting off 
		the train to look at It. I was often sorry that I missed the seeing of 
		such a place when I was so near it, but the work I was engaged In must 
		have been absorbing all my attention that time.</font></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><font size="4">Arriving 
		at Derry I put up at Roddy's Hotel. I had a letter of introduction to 
		Dr. McKnight, editor of the Derry Journal. He was a Presbyterian 
		gentleman, who had been very active In the Land League movement of 1852. 
		I delivered my letter to him at his office, and we walked out on the 
		Derry Wall, talking till we came to Walker's monument before which we 
		stoma I there told hint ray mission and my business with him. He was 
		impressed with the great power of England, with the great strength of 
		her army and navy and with the illimitable resources in the way of 
		raising loans of money. He thought the Irish people were not able to 
		beat England in open warfare, but when I told him of the organization we 
		had among the soldiers in the English army, he brightened up and seemed 
		to have hopes of success. But he was too old, he said, to take upon 
		himself the obligation of a soldier; then in citing me to spend the 
		evening at his house, which I respectfully declined, as it might attract 
		attention to me or to him. I parted from him, having received from him 
		letters of Introduction to friends of his in other places. Dr. McKnight 
		might have been at that time about 70 or 75 years of age. His hair was 
		white, but fire and youth would come into his eyes when speaking of his 
		country's wrongs and of the duty of righting them.</font></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><font size="4">I had 
		introductions to some of the Catholic Irishmen of Derry, but many of 
		them were away front the city just then. One of them named MacMenamin 
		was in Buncrana, some nine miles to the northeast of Derry, In the 
		County Donegal, and I took the train to Buncrana. I met my man and found 
		him a good one. When I had finished my business with him I hired a 
		jaunting car from Tommy Doherty, and he drove me back to Derry. Coming 
		along the way he pointed out to me the old historic places at each side 
		of the road. There was Cahir O'Doherty at the right hand side to the 
		north, and there were the ruins of Ailech at our left, where, as the 
		legend has it, the old warriors of Donegal lie sleeping with their 
		horses standing by them ready bridled and saddled, all to start into 
		life and action against the English enemy &quot;when the day comes&quot; and the 
		trump[et] of war is sounded:</font></p>
		<span style="font-family: Times New Roman"><font size="4">
		<br clear="all" style="page-break-before: always">
&nbsp;</font></span><p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">
		<font size="4">&nbsp;</font></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:81.0pt"><font size="4">Then pass 
		we on to Ulster to the hills of Donegal. </font></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:99.0pt;text-indent:-.25in">
		<font size="4">Where a host of ancient warriors lie in the enchanted 
		hall</font></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: -.25in; margin-left: 99.0pt">
		<font size="4">Awaiting call to battle from the trumpet sounding shrill—
		</font></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:99.0pt;text-indent:-.25in">
		<font size="4">They cannot rise till war's loud cries resound throughout 
		each hill.</font></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><font size="4">That 
		verse of an old song that got into my head about those dead heroes of 
		Donegal who are “waiting for the time” and for “the opportunity,” might 
		have been written by some poet who meant to satirize the living heroes 
		of his own day who were dead or sleeping—&quot;waiting for the time&quot; and the 
		opportunity. They are pretty applicable, too, to the living heroes of 
		the present day—all waiting to free Ireland—waiting till some one else 
		will come to free it for them. &quot;England's difficulty is Ireland's 
		opportunity,&quot; they say, but when England's difficulty comes It brings no 
		opportunity to them to do anything; they are not prepared; England is 
		out of the difficulty in three or four months' time. and then the parrot 
		peacock-feather patriots of Ireland proclaim again that England's 
		difficulty is Ireland's opportunity, and thus from generation to 
		generation they go on playing their game of &quot;carry the foot further,&quot; 
		never inculcating the maxim that &quot;they who would be free, themselves 
		must strike the blow,&quot; always leaving to each succeeding generation the 
		discharge of a duty that belongs to each present generation.</font></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><font size="4">Having 
		done my business in Donegal and Derry I went down to Lifford, and from 
		there went to Tyrone at the western side, stopping at Strabane, and I 
		calling to see Thomas Neilson Underwood, who, as I said in my last 
		letter, was a grand nephew of Thomas Neilson, one of the '98 patriots. 
		This Thomas Neilson is buried in Poughkeepsie, the State of New York. 
		Charles Underwood O'Connell, who was in prison with me and who is now 
		chief clerk in the Bureau of Naturalization In New York, tells me Samuel 
		Neilson was the author of the song:</font></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:1.0in;text-align:justify">
		<font size="4">'Tis the green, oh, the green, is the color of the time,</font></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:1.0in;text-align:justify">
		<font size="4">We will raise it 'gainst the Orange, and we'll back it 
		o'er the blue.</font></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:1.0in;text-align:justify">
		<font size="4">'Tis the color of our fatherland that here alone is seen,</font></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:1.0in;text-align:justify">
		<font size="4">'Tis the color of our martyred dead — our own immortal 
		green.</font></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><font size="4">I spent a 
		part of the day with Thomas Neilson Underwood, and getting a letter of 
		introduction from him to George Henry Moore, of Mayo, I bade him goodby. 
		That night I laid myself down at Omagh, in the County of Tyrone, and 
		having spent the night with some good men there, I sot out for 
		Enniskillen next morning.</font></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><font size="4">I had an 
		idle day in Enniskillen and went out to look at the country. I walked up 
		a hill that overlooks the town, and on the top of the hill I found a big 
		cannon planted; it was a reminder to the people that England held sway 
		there. I then walked along the banks of Lough Erne at the other side of 
		the town, and reached an old Irish castle in ruins. I entered it, looked 
		around and thought of the giantly people that must have built such a 
		giantly structure. They were the Maguires of Fermanagh, and I was 
		looking at their rule and at the ruins of Maguire's Castle on &quot;the 
		winding banks of Erne&quot; There are Maguires in Brooklyn and New York, big, 
		proud Maguires, too, but they are pigmies compared with the Fermanagh 
		Maguires of olden times; they have lost their Irish and have grown 
		degenerate. The foreigner owns their ancient halls and their ancient 
		fame, and they are in a strange land aping at being freemen, while the 
		brand of slavery is on their name and race. And so it is of all the rest 
		of the &quot;old stock.&quot;</font></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><font size="4">I put up 
		at a hotel in Enniskillen. There was only one public parlor in it, and 
		in that public parlor there was a landlord's agent receiving the rents 
		of the landlord's estate that day. A tall old lady, called widow 
		Maguire, stood at the table counting out her money—counting it out to 
		pay the Englishman for land that belonged to her fathers. She was short 
		a couple of shillings, the landlord refused to give her a clear receipt 
		for the rent, and she began to cry; but her tears fell dry upon the 
		agent's feelings. She had the whole of the nominal rent, but in the 
		springtime of the year the agent had given her some flaxseed for the 
		farm, for which he was now charging payment, and she had not the price 
		of the flaxseed with her. As she hadn't it, he would not give her the 
		clear receipt for the rent, and she kept crying and moaning how in the 
		world she could face the boys at home without the clear receipt or the 
		money. He would not give her back the money. I had to leave that room, 
		and I think now that in spite of me I was crying too. But there was a 
		policeman there, and I was there in private, and I could not interfere 
		anyway without attracting to myself some attention which might interfere 
		with the mission on which I was traveling. Some scenes get photographed 
		on a person's mind, and the picture remains there during life; that 
		picture of landlordism at the hotel in Enniskillen I will carry alive to 
		my grave.</font></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><font size="4">Next 
		morning I took the train for Lisnaskea in Fermanagh; I came out at 
		Lisnaskea and I walked the road to the next station place—Maguire's 
		Bridge. I did that to evade the eyes of the police, who are posted at 
		the different railway stations to observe every traveling stranger. At 
		Maguire's Bridge Ned Cosgrove, of Belfast, was to meet me that day. It 
		was his native village and I met him at the appointed place.</font></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><font size="4">We 
		traveled northward toward Tempo, the birthplace of the late Hugh 
		Hastings, of New York. We called into the house of a miller named Logue, 
		at Brookborough, and had dinner there—for nothing. We then went to the 
		house of a farmer named Murphy and stayed there all night. In the 
		morning early we arose to resume our journey, but there must have been 
		slaughter in that house all night, for such a table of boiled chickens 
		and ducks and geese I did not see before or since as was laid before us 
		for breakfast that morning. After breakfast a few of the Murphy boys 
		went across the fields with us to Tempo, and there for the sum of £1 we 
		engaged a horse and carriage to travel with us all day. The first place 
		we halted at was Fivemiletown, and when our business there was done Mr. 
		Hart, one of Mr. Cosgrove's schoolmates, came on the car with us to the 
		next town, which was Clogher. It was a fair day in the town, and a good 
		day for work; numbers of young men from the country wore at the fair, 
		and Cosgrove and Hart and it Clogher man named Scullen knew the whole of 
		them. Hart and Scullen are now dead, and I speak of them without 
		periling the safety of soul or body—tall, straight, Tyrone men, standing 
		over six feet high, loving Ireland and hating England as intensely as 
		any other two men on earth or in heaven to-day. I felt that I was only 
		in the way of Cosgrove and Hart and Scullen, while they were talking to 
		the new recruits they were getting, because the three of them belonged 
		to another Irish society that was gotten up to repel the attacks of 
		Orangemen, and I did not belong to it. I told them I was very anxious to 
		see the old historic places of Clogher; that I would walk out while they 
		wore talking to their friends and would be back in an hour's time. I 
		strolled into the churchyard of the town and looked at the names on the 
		tombstones and saw graven on one stone that under it lay the remains of 
		a woman who was the affectionate wife of a certain man, and also of 
		another woman who was the affectionate wife of the same certain man. He 
		had buried the two wives in the same grave. That grave is about thirty 
		yards to the left band side of you as you stand looking out from the 
		front door of Clogher Church.</font></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><font size="4">I 
		strolled into the graveyard of Holy Cross Abbey another day, and reading 
		the tombstones there I read an epitaph which is worth recording in 
		America. It Is this:</font></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:1.5in;text-align:justify">
		<font size="4">Return and do the good</font></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:1.5in;text-align:justify">
		<font size="4">Which were I now, I would; </font></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:1.5in;text-align:justify">
		<font size="4">Remember, thou wilt be</font></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:1.5in;text-align:justify">
		<font size="4">In dust, as now rest I.</font></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><font size="4">A 
		reminder to us all that we may all do more good than we arc doing on 
		earth while we have the power. when we are in the other world we cannot 
		do much for the nearest and dearest that belong to us here. To do as 
		much good and as little harm in this world as possible was one of the 
		active principles of the old Irish religion.</font></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><font size="4">When Ned 
		Cosgrove and I had done our business at Clogher we drove on to Augher, a 
		town three or four miles distant, I had a letter of introduction from 
		Newtownards to one of the MacKennas who lived there; he is now dead, but 
		having transacted our business with him that day, we faced our horse for 
		Aughnacloy. Delaying here for some time and seeing some of the men 
		there, we went on to Tynan and Caledon. This is the country of the 
		O'Neills, and a more charming tract of country there is not in Ireland 
		than the land and the stream and the wood between Aughnacloy and 
		Caledon. At Tynan we stopped to looked (sic) at an old Irish stone cross 
		that is fenced in on the cross road of the village. We wondered that 
		such an old relic of the old faith was allowed to live in such a place, 
		for it was hero a hundred years ago that Orangeism had birth, and that 
		the fiercest of feuds were waged between the English and the Irish 
		parties of Irish birth.</font></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><font size="4">We went 
		into the domain and into the castle of the Duke of Caledon; he and his 
		family were in England, and the caretaker showed us through the house. 
		The mansion in olden time belonged to the O'Neills.</font></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><font size="4">Here we 
		parted with our jarvey and hes Irish jaunting car; we paid him off and 
		sent him on his way home to Tempo; Ned Cosgrove and I took the trains, 
		he for Belfast and I for Rathfriland. At Rathfriland I was to meet 
		Matthew McLarnin, of Portadown, who was to travel that district with me. 
		I met him, and we hired a car to take us to Loughbrickland told 
		Gullford.</font></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><font size="4">On our 
		way we overtook two bodies of men who were marching on the road to the 
		music of fifes and drums. After passing them Matthew said: &quot;It would be 
		a funny thing nosy if they were to know who we are and the business we 
		are on.&quot; They were Orangemen who were returning to their homes after 
		being at work in the fields all day, and it was customary to take their 
		fifes and drums with them and play their party tunes going to work in 
		the morning and coming from work in the evening, Matthew McLarnen and 
		myself spent a few days in this district; we called at Scarva, and the 
		men of the organization there told me it would be worth my while to go 
		into the domain and take a look at the Castle of the Queen's O'Reilly. I 
		went in and took a look at it and was impressed with the fact that the 
		Queen's men and the King's men in Ireland are hi possession of the fat 
		of the land—of the wealth and beauty of the land. This O'Reilly's castle 
		in Scarva is built in three wings; the open space faces the south, and 
		has a view of miles and miles of spreading country before it; the owner 
		is more English than the English themselves, one of his ancestors became 
		a turncoat and thus saved his lands from confiscation, and not alone 
		that, but came into possession of the lands of many of his clansmen who 
		remained true to the cause of country and creed. </font></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><font size="4">From 
		Scarva I made my way down to Newry, and here on a Sunday evening I met 
		John Nolan again, at the house of a man where it was agreed some thirty 
		or forty men were to meet us. We had a little difficulty here in getting 
		all of the men united; some wore working one way and some wore belonging 
		to another organization that admitted none but Catholics to membership. 
		I was asked if there were any Protestants belonging to our Irish 
		Revolutionary Brotherhood, and I answered that there were. I was told we 
		could not be trusted, that the majority of the Irishmen at that meeting 
		would have nothing to do with a society containing Protestants. I asked 
		was not Robert Emmet a Protestant, and did not their society in America 
		carry on their banners the picture of Robert Emmet. The man who was 
		questioning me replied that Robert Emmet was in the pay of the English 
		Government. I told them I could not believe that, and telling them I had 
		no hope of being able to do any good for Ireland in Newry, I took up my 
		hat and asked John Nolan to come away; the friends who were at our side 
		of the house got angry with the other friends, and as I left the room I 
		left the whole party in a very angry discussion. I did not wait to see 
		the end of it.</font></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><font size="4">Next day 
		I went to the fair of Camlough, three miles outside of Newry, and swore 
		in some men there, having been introduced to them by some friends who 
		met me by appointment at that fair.</font></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><font size="4">My next 
		call was to Armagh. I hired a jaunting car from a man named O'Toole and 
		drove toward Keady. On the side of the road by a little lake I saw a man 
		sitting down. I stopped the car and asked him was his name Frank 
		Brownlee? He said it was. I asked him another question which he answered 
		satisfactorily. We then traveled together that day to Keady and beyond 
		Keady, and back again to Keady and Armagh. This Frank Brownlee is now in 
		Paterson, N. J. He was a good and true man in Ireland, was subsequently 
		put in prison in Ireland and is one of the Irishmen who in America 
		remain good and true to the Irish cause.</font></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><font size="4">I parted 
		from Frank Brownlee next morning. He went his way and I went mine. I 
		went into the County Monaghan and came out of the train at a station 
		called Glaslough. Here there were some police on watch duty. They were 
		expecting some strangers and I found myself under their notice. I soon 
		found out that the man they were looking for was Joe Coburn. He was to 
		engage in a prize fight those days and they wore on duty to prevent the 
		fight taking place. Joe's native place was Middletown, three or four 
		miles distant.</font></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><font size="4">As soon 
		as I was relieved of police attention I thought of going to Tyholland, a 
		place where lived James Blaney Rice. I knew I was within two or three 
		miles of the place when I was in Glaslough; I traveled into the country 
		and walked a couple of miles of a road with a big high wall at my left 
		hand side all along. I was almost cursing the man who owned that wall, 
		who built it and shut out from me the country's view. His name was 
		Leslie, he was a landlord and he had the wall built to shut in himself 
		and his castle and his demesne from the eyes of the neighbors. When I 
		passed Leslie's place, I went into a house on the roadside and inquired 
		where was Tyholland. I was shown where it was, three or four miles in 
		the distance, was told the easiest way to get there was to go back to 
		Glaslough; but I did not want to travel by Leslie's wall again, so I 
		went on the top of a high ditch and, like a fox after being unbagged 
		looking for the course he would take, I looked for the straight course 
		to James Blaney Rice's house and traveled the fields toward it. When I 
		reached it the family were after dinner, but James Blaney's sister was 
		not long getting a special dinner ready for me. Many a family has 
		suffered in Ireland through connection with Fenianism or through 
		connection with Ireland, I may say. Many a home has been broken up, many 
		a home has been scattered. James Blaney Rice, with his house, his home 
		and his family, is one. I saw him in New York the other day—a gray, old 
		looking, world wearied man; he had lost Tyholland, though he had the 
		lands of it in my time at half a crown an acre; he had no repinings for 
		his loss, for his sufferings for his worldly misfortunes; he still 
		talked of the old cause and of the happy day in the immediate future 
		when Ireland would be free, and when he and all other Irishmen would 
		have their own again. In Tyholland, in the Autumn of 1864, I made 
		arrangements with James Blaney Rice that he, with a few of the principal 
		men in his neighborhood, should meet me at the house of Barney Reilly in 
		Glaslough road, In the Town of Monaghan, next evening. That same Barney 
		Reilly is in New York to-day, and a good man still.</font></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><font size="4">I had a 
		letter of introduction from the Rev. David Bell to an acquaintance of 
		his, who lived about a mile to the north of Monaghan Town, and I went to 
		deliver it. I found my man; he was a Black Northern Presbyterian and his 
		name was Joseph Glass. A tall, respectable looking gentleman, over six 
		feet high, but apparently in delicate health. I delivered my letter; he 
		read it; he walked out in the fields with me, and while walking kept 
		talking. &quot;I am in delicate health,&quot; said be;&quot; it is not likely I will 
		live long. I am heart and soul with any movement that will free my 
		country any way. I have conscientious scruples regarding the taking of 
		an oath, the obligation of which I know I am not able to perform. I am 
		not able to take up arms and fight at a moment's warning. My health will 
		not permit me. If you omit that part of the oath I will swear to the 
		rest of it.&quot; When parting from Mr. Glass he said to me, &quot;Now, I have a 
		horse and carriage here; they are at your service any day you want them, 
		or at the service of any friend of yours who will be traveling this way 
		any day.&quot; Joe Glass is gone to the other world long ago; God rest his 
		soul there!</font></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><font size="4">Having 
		done my business in Monaghan, I hired a car for the Town of Cavan. I 
		went through Cootehill, and outside Cootehill saw big Nelson monument 
		looking affair, erected in a field at the left hand side of the road. I 
		went in to look at it, and read on the side stones at the base the 
		legend that the pile was raised to commemorate the life of a man named 
		Dawson, who was killed in the Crimean War. I thought it a queer place to 
		have a Crimean hero commemorated, and thought of a time to come when it 
		would be the duty of Irishmen to remove all such monuments as that from 
		the soil of Ireland.</font></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><font size="4">I had an 
		introduction to some men in a place between Cootehill and Cavan. I 
		stopped at a wayside inn kept by Barney Fay, and he sent for the men I 
		wanted; he had a number of men digging potatoes in a field near by and I 
		told him to send for them too, as he told me they were good, reliable 
		men. I met them all and I found they all belonged to another Irish 
		society such as the one I met in Newry. I could make no hand of them; if 
		the society was a religious one, or in defense of their religion they 
		would join it, otherwise they would have nothing to do with it or with 
		me.</font></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><font size="4">I came on 
		to the Town of Cavan, met an old Skibbereen neighbor of mine named 
		Henderson, who is now a magistrate of the County Cavan. We got talking. 
		I told him I was out traveling establishing agencies for the Irish 
		people. I got word here that I was wanted in Dublin. I arrived in Dublin 
		next morning and was told at the office that arrangements had been made 
		to have Edward Duffy and myself travel through Connacht. I left Dublin 
		next day and met Edward Dully in Connacht the day after. We spent three 
		or four weeks making our tour of &quot;treason&quot; through the western province, 
		but before I go through that tour I must tell who my companion was and 
		what was his fate.</font></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><font size="4">Edward 
		Duffy belonged to Lough Glynn, in the County Roscommon. He was brought 
		up to the drapery or dry goods business, and when Fenianism was started 
		he was clerk to Mrs. Duff, of Ballaghadereen, who was a sister of John 
		B. Dillon, the father of the present John Dillon, of the Land League 
		movement. Edward Duffy joined the Fenian movement and became a very 
		active organizer. He was trusted by James Stephens and by every one who 
		knew him, and well worthy of the trust he was. When James Stephens 
		escaped from prison and came to America, in 1866, Edward Duffy in 
		Ireland was his confidential man. I have some of the letters James 
		Stephens wrote to him. and will publish them if I continue my story of 
		the Fenian movement down to the end of the year 1866. Edward Duffy was 
		arrested by the English and sentenced to fifteen years' penal servitude; 
		he was taken to London, lodged in the prison of Millbank and most 
		cruelly treated there by the English. They worried him to death. I was 
		in Milbank Prison the time he died. I was told by a warden he expressed 
		a wish to see me, I applied to the governor and to the visiting director 
		of the prison for permission to see Edward Duffy before he died, I was 
		asked how did I know he was in the prison, I told them when I was at 
		mass a few Sundays ago I saw him going to communion; they would not give 
		me permission to see him. A visit from some family friend in the outside 
		world is allowed to a convict every six months, I had no visit from any 
		one for six months, I said a visit was due to me from some one, and I 
		would forego that visit for the privilege of seeing Edward Duffy. No, 
		they would not let me see him. I was in my cell a few days after, and 
		through the grated ventilator of it the whispered words came to me 
		&quot;Duffy is dead.&quot; True enough he was dead; on his deathbed he asked to 
		see me and this dying request of his was refused by his English jailors. 
		Yes, I read it in the London papers one time--I read a scathing 
		denunciation of Russian barbarity—read how two Polish comrades were 
		imprisoned in St. Petersburg, how one of them was dying, how ho asked 
		that his comrade in prison be allowed to see him, and how his dying 
		request was refused. That was the barbarity of the Russian that England 
		denounced as inhuman; here was a similar case of two comrade prisoners 
		belonging to England's Poland, occurring in the heart of England, in the 
		heart of London. within a stone's throw of the headquarters of the Bible 
		societies of the world, and England's Christian heart was as hard as 
		stone. The act which in Russia denoted barbarity, in England denoted 
		civilization and discipline.</font></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:1.5in;text-align:justify">
		<font size="4">‘Tis you're the sinner always, she's the saint.</font></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><font size="4">Edward 
		Duffy was in business one time with the Gannon brothers, of Castlerea; 
		he had two sisters who wore school teachers, living with their mother, 
		he was at the time of his arrest under engagement to be married to Miss 
		Mary O'Leary, sister to John O'Leary, editor of the Irish People, a most 
		estimable lady who died shortly after the death of her betrothed. In the 
		darkness of my prison chamber I wrote out, or rather thought out, for I 
		had no pen to write the following lines on the death of my comrade;</font></p>
