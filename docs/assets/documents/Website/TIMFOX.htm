        <p class="MsoEndnoteText" style="line-height: 100%"><font size="3"><b>There
        has been no definitive biography of John Charles O’Neill, though
        numerous newspaper and periodicals, especially in the mid-nineteenth
        century, portrayed the General’s career piecemeal. Several of these
        early articles were often written with direct assistance from O’Neill
        himself.</b></font></p>
        <p class="MsoEndnoteText" style="line-height: 100%"><font size="3"><b>After
        the General’s death in 1878, scant further information appeared until
        the unveiling of his monument in Omaha in 1919, and then only from a
        published speech anointing the Monaghan born O’Neill. As time has gone
        on, O’Neill has passed into legend, much like the gunfighters of the
        old West, whose stories are filled with exaggeration and untruths, mixed
        with some true history.</b></font></p>
        <p class="MsoEndnoteText" style="line-height: 100%"><font size="3"><b>Though
        the arrival of the Internet has allowed the story of John O’Neill to
        remain alive, inaccuracies and misinformation has often been repeated
        until they are now accepted as history. In 1937, Sister Mary M. Langan,
        wrote the first dissertation on O’Neill, and though leaning toward a
        very Catholic public relations view of the man, was helped by input from
        the O’Neill grandchildren, and gives some valuable information on his
        family, though far from complete.</b></font></p>
        <p class="MsoEndnoteText" style="line-height: 100%"><font size="3"><b>Many
        articles have reported on specific aspects of his life, in particular
        his time with the Fenians from 1865 until 1868 (this is the best history
        of the General thus covered); others have focused on the Nebraska era of
        his life (1874-78); while some recent views have been put forth by Irish
        nationalists claiming O’Neill was one of the greatest Irish freedom
        fighters since the Famine.</b></font></p>
        <p class="MsoEndnoteText" style="line-height: 100%"><font size="3"><b>There
        are descendants of O’Neill still in the United States, a small few in
        southern New Jersey and Staten Island, New York, and a large contingent
        in California, but none named O’Neill. I have ended the paper with the
        death of the General’s last progeny named O’Neill, especially in
        light of privacy for those involved.</b></font></p>
        <p class="MsoEndnoteText" style="line-height: 100%"><font size="3"><b>This
        paper is an attempt to bring into focus a more balanced view of the life
        of John Charles O’Neill, particularly his early and later life. Much
        of his career has often been told haphazardly, so I hope this research
        helps us understand the person and the passion of a man often
        misunderstood.</b></font></p>

        <p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 100%"><b><font size="3">He was
        born in Ireland and died in Nebraska, but John Charles O’Neill was the
        most famous Irishman ever to call New Jersey ‘home.’ O’Neill was a
        celebrity, a pop star whose three careers are reason to be studied and
        honored, but whom today is largely forgotten, if not unknown.</font></b></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 100%"><b><font size="3">Dying
        tragically young of a stroke at forty-four, O’Neill served heroically
        during the Civil War, rising from enlisted man to Captain; he commanded
        not one but three invasions into Canada for the cause of Irish freedom;
        and led a colonization of eastern seaboard Irish immigrants to Nebraska,
        where the town of O’Neill would be named in his honor.</font></b></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 100%"><b><font size="3">John
        O’Neill possessed all the qualities of a modern star. Strong, darkly
        handsome and charming, he captivated people with a “rich sonorous
        voice.”<a style="mso-endnote-id:edn1" href="#_edn1" name="_ednref1" title><span class="MsoEndnoteReference">1</span></a>
        This adopted son of New Jersey was compulsive and ambitious, yet
        inspired loyalty in thousands. One newspaper said O’Neill<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
        </span>“was of calm temperament, but with a firm will, and when
        excited was stern.”<a style="mso-endnote-id:edn2" href="#_edn2" name="_ednref2" title><span class="MsoEndnoteReference">2</span></a>
        As with many celebrities, however, he sometimes appeared arrogant,
        unbending, and even manipulative.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>At
        the end he let alcohol get in the way. But the O’Neill story is
        compelling, and like William Grace, another nineteenth century immigrant
        whose American success occurred after very improbable beginnings in
        rural Ireland, John O’Neill’s story is a novelist’s dream.</font></b></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 100%"><b><font size="3">John,
        never ‘Jack,’ was born March 8, 1834 to a grieving widow in
        Drumgallon townland, near Clontibert in County Monaghan, and named after
        his dead father. Catherine (nee Macklin) O’Neill’s husband John had
        gone to assist some neighbors while cholera was once again rampant in
        Ulster, only to succumb himself just weeks before Catherine gave birth
        to her third child at age twenty-nine.<a style="mso-endnote-id:edn3" href="#_edn3" name="_ednref3" title><span class="MsoEndnoteReference">3</span></a></font></b></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 100%"><b><font size="3">There
        was no good time in Ireland to be a young widow with three children
        under the age of four, and Catherine soon moved four year old Bernard,
        two year old Mary, and baby John O’Neill to her parents, George and
        Mary Macklin. Catherine would lean on her family and remain near them
        the rest of her widowed life, both in Ireland and America.<a style="mso-endnote-id:edn4" href="#_edn4" name="_ednref4" title><span class="MsoEndnoteReference">4</span></a></font></b></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 100%"><b><font size="3">Though
        all of Ireland has been a birth haven of rebels for centuries, the East
        Monaghan and South Armagh area of young John’s early upbringing has
        long been linked with a raised level of virulent ancient hatreds,
        centuries old vendettas, and is even today often referred to as
        ‘bandit country.’ During the first decade of O’Neill’s life, the
        British military was called out to break popular local resistance and
        secret societies abounded on both Catholic and Protestant sides. Irish
        novelist Benedict Kiely said pre-famine Monaghan “was a land infested
        with disorder and injustice, a place where men were bitterly
        discontented, a land where slavery and oppression were real.”<a style="mso-endnote-id:edn5" href="#_edn5" name="_ednref5" title><span class="MsoEndnoteReference">5</span></a></font></b></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 100%"><b><font size="3">By
        1840, when she was thirty-five, Catherine O’Neill and younger brother
        John Macklin left this exceedingly tense land and settled in Elizabeth,
        New Jersey. She and John opened a grocery business on Elizabeth Avenue,
        then and now the main street in New Jersey’s fourth largest city.<a style="mso-endnote-id:edn6" href="#_edn6" name="_ednref6" title><span class="MsoEndnoteReference">6</span></a>
        Why they chose Elizabeth is not known, but in 1840 there were not many
        Irish wanted in the town, though the timing would prove right for the
        Monaghan immigrants. With the advent of the railroad plus the soon to be
        exodus of famine victims, thousands of Irish would settle in Elizabeth
        almost overnight, and the Macklin/O’Neill grocery would soon be a
        staple of the local community. Within just a few years, St. Mary’s,
        the first Catholic Church in the two hundred year old history of
        Elizabeth would be erected, and John Macklin would be a major
        benefactor. Indeed, both John and Catherine would never leave Elizabeth,
        and would be buried in the tiny St. Mary Cemetery on South Washington
        Avenue.<a style="mso-endnote-id:edn7" href="#_edn7" name="_ednref7" title><span class="MsoEndnoteReference">7</span></a></font></b></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 100%"><b><font size="3">No
        doubt Catherine missed her children immensely, and three years after
        leaving them with her parents, Bernard, now thirteen, and Mary, eleven,
        crossed the ocean and were reunited with their mother. Bernard was
        immediately put to work as a clerk with his uncle John and Mary and
        Catherine kept house above the store.<a style="mso-endnote-id:edn8" href="#_edn8" name="_ednref8" title><span class="MsoEndnoteReference">8</span></a>
        Baby John, the future soldier, was left home in Drumgallon, and in an
        1867 interview, said his grandparents, George and Mary Macklin, pleaded
        in letters to Catherine to let him stay in Ireland to ease their hearts
        as they grew old. Catherine conceded, and it would be five more years
        before John would see his brother, sister, and mother.<a style="mso-endnote-id:edn9" href="#_edn9" name="_ednref9" title><span class="MsoEndnoteReference">9</span></a></font></b></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 100%"><b><font size="3">One has
        to wonder at the price paid on the break-up of a family, and there is
        always a price. In effect, John O’Neill, who never knew a father, was
        also left motherless from age six to fourteen. Despite being educated
        locally and raised by loving grandparents, Monaghan was a tough locale
        in those formative years, and John was exposed to life in a closed and
        dark side of rural Ireland.</font></b></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 100%"><b><font size="3">Despite
        this often repressive atmosphere, there is no doubt O’Neill was well
        schooled. Family tradition has always maintained that his Catholic and
        anti-English grandfather, George Macklin, refused to send him to the
        local school for fear of being raised an anglophile, and instead hired a
        tutor for the young lad.<a style="mso-endnote-id:
edn10" href="#_edn10" name="_ednref10" title><span class="MsoEndnoteReference">10</span></a>
        As a young man in America, O’Neill himself said, “When I was a young
        boy I attentively read the history of my native land and her public men.
        I wept over the speeches of her orators, and asked myself whom of the
        Irish patriots I would seek to emulate. I decided that eloquence would
        not do unless it be that which follows from the cannon’s mouth.”<a style="mso-endnote-id:edn11" href="#_edn11" name="_ednref11" title><span class="MsoEndnoteReference">11</span></a>
        Even allowing for adult hyperbole, it is obvious grandfather Macklin did
        his job well, and when John finally settled in Elizabeth, he would never
        be comfortable at a grocery clerk’s settled and quiet life.</font></b></p>

        would get worse, not better, after Bernard and Mary left brother John
        home in Drumgallon. Hunger struck in 1845 when he was eleven. Perhaps
        Catherine, like most people, thought the one-year potato failure would
        be temporary. There had, after all, been countless one-year failures,
        but for the next four years, famine, typhus, fever, and emigration would
        reduce the Irish population from eight to five million. Monaghan had
        been the hardest hit of all Ulster counties, with 30% of the population
        gone by 1851. The disastrous effect on the minds of the Irish has been
        studied and debated for over a century, but never completely understood,
        but to a young boy without a father and missing a mother, it was simple
        – the English had to get out of Ireland. O’Neill would spend his
        entire life trying to make it happen.</font></b></p>

        fate of the elderly George and Mary Macklin, like a million others, is

        </span>The dark haired, good-looking teenager’s arrival must have been
        a stark study in contrasts. Fluent in both Irish and English, the boy
        surely must have rejoiced in being reunited with his mother, brother,
        and sister. Additionally he now shared a home with his uncle, John
        Macklin, his wife Sarah, and two new young cousins, also named George
        and Mary Macklin.<a style="mso-endnote-id:edn13" href="#_edn13" name="_ednref13" title><span class="MsoEndnoteReference">13</span></a>
        Comfort in a new home with a loving family and no fear of hunger was
        definitely a positive. But John had not seen his mother since he was
        six, and the grandparents who raised him were now gone overnight. That
        he might be independent and detached would be an understatement. His
        very popular brother Bernard was now eighteen, and had a five-year head
        start on American life, but he and his younger brother would eventually
        walk two very different paths.<a style="mso-endnote-id:edn14" href="#_edn14" name="_ednref14" title><span class="MsoEndnoteReference">14</span></a></font></b></p>

        Though one branch might live in New Jersey, cousins, siblings, and
        in-laws found each other, no matter where they settled. This lack of
        outreach makes one believe that this particular Macklin/O’Neill family
        group lived as they had in Monaghan, inclusively staying in Elizabeth
        for fifty years before branching out even a little, and then, only one
        strayed permanently more than twenty miles from the original home base
        of Elizabeth. The one glaring exception would be the last arrival, John

        settled in his American home, John went to the new Saint Mary School for
        one year before going to work at the family grocery. But while brother
        Bernard thrived at the business, John felt constrained. In 1852 after
        three years working with groceries in Elizabeth, John quit and went to
        work as a book salesman for a New York publisher, traveling throughout
        New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Maryland, and Virginia.<a style="mso-endnote-id:edn16" href="#_edn16" name="_ednref16" title><span class="MsoEndnoteReference">16</span></a>
        It was a sudden move, and against his mothers wishes, but it is hardly

        all places, Richmond, Virginia. It would predictably fail within two
        years, the Catholic population of the area not enough to support the
        young bachelor. But it was in Richmond that O’Neill literally ran into

        notion that England would soon be at war with Russia, thus opening the
        way for all Irish freedom fighters. It was the perfect outlet for the
        hazel-eyed O’Neill. For almost two years John trained with the E.M.A.,
        but when an English war with Russia no longer seemed viable, and his
        bookstore now a failure, he headed north. With the prospect of returning
        to his family a failure, or thoughts of having to work with groceries,
        the budding soldier ran into U.S. Army recruiters in Baltimore. The army
        was actively searching for men to quash what would be called the Utah
        War against the Mormons, and the twenty-three year old O’Neill again
        made a sudden decision and signed on in May, 1857 with the U.S. Second

        May 1857 until July 1858, and there was not a single armed fatality or
        one pitched battle. The Mormon’s chief success was burning three
        wagons loaded with 50,000 pounds of supplies, while the 2,500 U.S.
        soldiers showed their might simply with its presence. Overall discipline

        cent of the force sent to Utah. Army pay records show O’Neill deserted
        at the very end of this sloppy affair on August 2, 1858, but desertion
        is desertion, and it would haunt O’Neill and some of his favorite
        biographers, who downplayed it or ignored it when O’Neill’s career

        Sometime in the course of this stay, the now twenty-five year old met a
        fifteen-year-old Australian orphan, Mary Ann Crow. Mary Ann, a footnote
        in most tellings of the O’Neill story, would be the biggest influence
        on his life, her love complete, and at the end, her heartbreak total.</font></b></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 100%"><b><font size="3">Mary
        Ann was the Melbourne born daughter of Patrick and Bridget Crow, Irish
        immigrants to Australia. The Crows arrived in Port Phillip in 1841, but
        by 1848 Patrick had declared insolvency as a farmer in Campbelltown near
        Sydney, and decided to try his luck in California.<a style="mso-endnote-id:edn24" href="#_edn24" name="_ednref24" title><span class="MsoEndnoteReference">24</span></a>
        Along with their only child, five-year-old Mary Ann, they left Melbourne
        for the gold rush on the <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">William
        Watson, </i>a 489-ton barque bound for San Francisco on June 25, 1849.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
        </span>Their ship was the first to leave Melbourne and carried 161
        passengers, including eight children, 157 who survived after an 82 day
        voyage.<a style="mso-endnote-id:edn25" href="#_edn25" name="_ednref25" title><span class="MsoEndnoteReference">25</span></a>
        Anticipation was high, and even the editor of the <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Melbourne

        her return trip with gold.”<a style="mso-endnote-id:edn26" href="#_edn26" name="_ednref26" title><span class="MsoEndnoteReference">26</span></a>
        But like so many others they found not gold but death, perhaps victims
        of cholera, which struck many traveling from Australia to California.
        Hundreds of Australian orphans were adopted by the Sisters of Charity
        and educated in their new orphanage, which opened in 1852. Trained by
        the sisters, Mary Ann at some point made the acquaintance of the
        handsome soldier and he was smitten.<a style="mso-endnote-id:edn27" href="#_edn27" name="_ednref27" title><span class="MsoEndnoteReference">27</span></a>
        Over time, he explained his rather precarious situation and Mary Ann,
        despite her youth, helped convince the stubborn, headstrong, and
        independent deserter to rethink his behavior. O’Neill himself, almost
        two years into his ‘French leave,’ had a precipitous encounter in
        downtown San Francisco with an officer he recognized from Utah, who was
        either on leave or assignment. The Irishman identified himself, and
        began the process of a return to duty.<a style="mso-endnote-id:edn28" href="#_edn28" name="_ednref28" title><span class="MsoEndnoteReference">2</span></a><span class="MsoEndnoteReference">8</span></font></b></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 100%"><b><font size="3">It must
        have been a scene Shakespeare would envy. A teenaged Australian orphan,
        left abandoned for years, 8,000 miles from home, raised and educated by
        Irish nuns who often acted as matchmakers. This young woman cares for
        and advises a twenty-three year old Irish semi-orphan, 10,000 miles from
        home, wanted by his new nation as a deserter. Nonetheless, O’Neill
        must have agonized over the decision. After all, San Francisco was a
        great place to be in 1860, especially for a bright, ambitious Irishman.
        The past decades gold rush had brought thousands to California, and the
        California Irish were way ahead of their brethren on the east coast
        politically, culturally, and often, economically.<a style="mso-endnote-id:edn29" href="#_edn29" name="_ednref29" title><span class="MsoEndnoteReference">29</span></a>
        While many Irish immigrants struggled in poverty in the east, San
        Francisco was emerging from a building boom, and would show steady
        growth during the two years John was a resident. Whether it was Mary
        Ann’s common sense, or the self-realization that he was a soldier at
        heart, O’Neill decided to rejoin the dragoons and face the music of a
        two year absence without leave.</font></b></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 100%"><b><font size="3">While
        the majority of the U.S. Army Utah Expedition had returned east, the 1<sup>st</sup>
        Dragoons had continued west to Fort Crook in the foothills of northern
        California, directly west of Reno, Nevada. Fort Crook was two hundred
        miles north of San Francisco, and consisted of a few log buildings with
        no bunks for the men. The dragoons themselves numbered less than a
        hundred, and they were ostensibly there only to protect immigrants and
        settlers. In July of 1860, when O’Neill showed up and surrendered to a
        Captain Adams, it was as bleak and remote as any army post in the United
        States.<a style="mso-endnote-id:edn30" href="#_edn30" name="_ednref30" title><span class="MsoEndnoteReference">30</span></a></font></b></p>

        The few histories which mention this period of O’Neill’s career
        point out he was accepted back because of the impending Civil War, but
        in fact the 1<sup>st</sup> Dragoons at Fort Crook were desperate for
        manpower in a godforsaken outpost. O’Neill himself, after the Civil
        War, told friends it was the officer he met in San Francisco who
        smoothed the waters and influenced his restoration to duty. Indeed, the
        Civil War was not imminent in July 1860.<a style="mso-endnote-id:edn32" href="#_edn32" name="_ednref32" title><span class="MsoEndnoteReference">32</span></a></font></b></p>

        with his now sixteen-year-old sweetheart, but he would soon arrive after
        a four month journey in Washington for the Civil War’s first large

        Gaines Mills, and was praised by General Stoneman as “a brave and

        the conclusion of the month long fight around Richmond, many of the now

        leadership, and loyalty. A soldier who served under him in 1863 said

        John was also in touch with his family in New Jersey, whom he had not

        made the long and arduous journey east, traveling with a family headed
        to New York. She helped nurse her beloved soldier boy to health, and as

        Even Mary Ann, who more than likely had stayed in Elizabeth with the
        O’Neill family, couldn’t stop John from acting predictably. He
        resigned immediately. General Sturges could not reason with him, though
        he sent a memo to headquarters, which said in part, “This is an
        excellent officer – too valuable to be lost to the service . . . he is
        one of the best officers in my command.” But the New Jersey Irishman
        would not be placated, typical of both his past and future behavior.<a style="mso-endnote-id:edn39" href="#_edn39" name="_ednref39" title><span class="MsoEndnoteReference">39</span></a></font></b></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 100%"><b><font size="3">With a
        wedding in the fall, and no job, O’Neill was finally convinced to
        rejoin the army, but under circumstances that allowed him to maintain
        his dignity. Several friends, including future President Andrew Johnson,
        were instrumental in forming a number of “Colored” units in the west
        and O’Neill was appointed in June of 1864 as Captain of the 17<sup>th</sup>
        Colored Infantry with his headquarters in Nashville, Tennessee.<a style="mso-endnote-id:edn40" href="#_edn40" name="_ednref40" title><span class="MsoEndnoteReference">40</span></a>
        O’Neill had his promotion, but the war was coming to a close, and the
        organization of these troops was dispensed. Upset once more, the
        thin-skinned O’Neill tendered his resignation in November from his
        home in Nashville with five months of hard fighting still ahead. He
        headed home to Elizabeth and there his beloved Aussie and the
        hard-headed Irishman were married on November 27, 1864 by the Reverend
        Isaac Howell at St. Mary’s Church, the church his mother and Uncle
        John Macklin had been helpful in establishing.<a style="mso-endnote-id:edn41" href="#_edn41" name="_ednref41" title><span class="MsoEndnoteReference">41</span></a></font></b></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 100%"><b><font size="3">The
        witnesses were unusual for an Irish wedding. John’s only sister Mary,
        now thirty-two, was Mary Ann’s maid of honor, the young bride having
        no remaining family. John’s best man was his first cousin, George
        Macklin, now twenty, and not his only brother, Bernard, thirty-four.
        John and George had only seen each other once in eight years since
        George was twelve, and though there is no record of discord between the
        two Drumgallon brothers, hints like the one above will grow in future
        years. It certainly would not be the first time two Irish brothers would
        lead different lives, and the career paths between the grocer and the
        soldier would widen more with age.<a style="mso-endnote-id:edn42" href="#_edn42" name="_ednref42" title><span class="MsoEndnoteReference">42</span></a></font></b></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 100%"><b><font size="3">The
        newlyweds did not, however, settle in Elizabeth, or even New Jersey.
        John and Mary Ann arrived in Nashville after Christmas, just weeks after
        the December battle in that Tennessee town that would end the war in the
        west. With the Confederate threat eliminated, and peace on the horizon,
        John O’Neill opened a real estate and claims agency, <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">O’Neill
        and Mitchell</i>, at 35 Cedar Street in May 1865.<a style="mso-endnote-id:edn43" href="#_edn43" name="_ednref43" title><span class="MsoEndnoteReference">43</span></a></font></b></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 100%"><b><font size="3">Throughout
        the land, thousands of survivors began the process of repairing,
        reinventing, or beginning new lives, and John O’Neill had a head start
        on most. With a sterling reputation, honored and respected as a veteran
        who had done much fighting, O’Neill’s future appeared bright, and
        his business, according to his later testimony, was very successful that
        first year. But the one disconnect in John O’Neill was his fervent
        hatred of England and his desire for Ireland to be free of its yoke. No
        business, family, or friendship could overcome his desire for Irish
        freedom. It would make him at one point one of the most celebrated men
        in the United States, a ‘General,’ and friend of a president. It
        would also make him bitter enemies and cause a chasm within his own
        family.</font></b></p>

        summer day in 1865, businessman John O’Neill took the Fenian oath,

        Ireland.</b></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 100%"><i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal"><b>“I,
        John O’Neill, solemnly pledge my sacred word of honor, as a truthful
        and honest man, that I will labor with my earnest zeal for the
        liberation of Ireland from the yoke of England, and for the
        establishment of a free and independent government on the Irish soil;
        that I will implicitly obey the commands of my superior officers in the
        Fenian Brotherhood, that I will faithfully discharge the duties of my
        membership as laid down in the constitution and by-laws thereof; that I
        will do my utmost to promote feelings of love, harmony, and kindly
        forbearance among all Irishmen; and that I will foster, defend, and
        propagate the afore-said Fenian Brotherhood to the utmost of my
        power.”<a style="mso-endnote-id:edn44" href="#_edn44" name="_ednref44" title><span class="MsoEndnoteReference">1</span></a><o:p>

        <p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 100%"><b>Each member paid
        one-dollar initiation fee and weekly dues of ten cents. The Brotherhood,
        as it was commonly known, had been recruiting members secretly since
        1858, “but paid recruiting members easily moved through both Union and
        Confederate armies” during wartime, often with official permission and
        escorts. The Fenian Brotherhood could be found everywhere, with one
        report stating there were more than 500 ‘Circles’ across the country
        and another 80 in Canada. It was an ambitious organization with
        hard-cash support. Money was never a problem in these early days, and
        there were times when $15,000 a day rolled into its coffers.<a style="mso-endnote-id:edn45" href="#_edn45" name="_ednref45" title><span class="MsoEndnoteReference">2</span></a></b></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 100%"><b>O’Neill did not join
        the Brotherhood until after the war, but he was well aware of its aims
        and ambitions, and within months he was one of the leaders of the
        Nashville ‘Circle.’ The F.B. eventually became “The only
        organization in United States history which armed and drilled publicly,
        and invaded Canada for the simple purpose of using seized land as a
        stepping-stone for the invasion and liberation of Ireland.”<a style="mso-endnote-id:edn46" href="#_edn46" name="_ednref46" title><span class="MsoEndnoteReference">3</span></a></b></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 100%"><b>The Nashville circle
        was one of the most dynamic in the country, contrary to some modern
        perceptions that everything Irish happened in the northeast cities.
        There was throughout the North America almost 600 circles, each with a
        minimum of sixty members, but could number in the hundreds. The
        Nashville circle of which O’Neill became an organizer was a large and
        active one from 1862 or earlier. Some of the most committed Fenians in
        the country were to be found within its borders when John and Mary Ann
        settled in as newlyweds, living in the fashionable Edgefield area on
        Russell Street.</b></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 100%"><b>The Nashville Fenians
        had already by 1863 built a Catholic orphanage and supported a large
        Saint Patrick’s Day celebration. James Stephens, a founding member of
        the F.B. had visited the southern city, and General Tom Sweeny, the
        future commander of the initial Fenian Army in America, was stationed in
        Nashville directly after the Civil War. The Nashville Circle would
        eventually number over 300 recruits, none more vocal than the legendary
        Thomas J. Kelly. The Galway born Kelly, who had been raising Irish
        consciousness since he moved to the Tennessee town in 1857, would
        eventually become an international Irish rebel, working for Irish
        freedom until he died in 1908, aged 75. In the years following the Civil
        War, Nashville was a beacon in the nation with an all-star cast of
        fighting Irish, and John O’Neill was one of the leading players.<a style="mso-endnote-id:edn47" href="#_edn47" name="_ednref47" title><span class="MsoEndnoteReference">4</span></a></b></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 100%"><b>By late 1865 this
        large body of strident Irishmen had become politicized but divided, no
        surprise to any Irish organization past or present. The Fenian
        Brotherhood leadership was divided into two distinct camps; one wanted a
        forced uprising in Ireland, but “at a later date.” The other, mostly
        American, angled for a quicker fight, and desirous of attacking Canada,
        forcing the British to defend the northern Dominion of their empire,
        thus freeing Ireland from a larger British defensive force. This split
        within the Brotherhood forced a third national Fenian Convention held at
        Philadelphia in October 1865, with more than six hundred delegates
        present.<a style="mso-endnote-id:edn48" href="#_edn48" name="_ednref48" title><span class="MsoEndnoteReference">5</span></a></b></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 100%"><b>The convention
        resulted in what would be shocking results today but which were accepted
        almost without complaint in the post-Civil War era. A ‘capital’ in a
        New York mansion that flew a Fenian Brotherhood flag; an officially
        raised army within American borders; negotiation with the United States
        Government; and an organization that basically acted as a sovereign
        nation were all approved and allowed without legal objection by the
        United States.<a style="mso-endnote-id:edn49" href="#_edn49" name="_ednref49" title><span class="MsoEndnoteReference">6</span></a></b></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 100%"><b>There is no record if
        the newly appointed ‘Colonel’ John O’Neill was present, or in
        Nashville drilling his equally new 13<sup>th</sup> Tennessee Fenian
        Regiment, but by December 1865, Fenian President William Roberts
        ‘Wing’ took control of the Brotherhood and the plan to invade Canada
        went forward with alacrity.<a style="mso-endnote-id:edn50" href="#_edn50" name="_ednref50" title><span class="MsoEndnoteReference">7</span></a></b></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 100%"><b>As bizarre as this
        sounds today, it was more than reasonable in 1866. The Fenians were
        serious business, though many English historians have tried to write
        them out of the history books. In addition to the thousands of Fenian
        Irish ready to fight, it also made sense to the leader of the land,
        President Andrew Johnson, and many other politicians. <span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;</span>For
        starters, the Canadian provinces were vulnerable. Some among the F.B.
        said if Texas could have been ‘annexed’ from Mexico in 1836 in
        similar fashion, surely a stronger Irish organization could capture
        Canada.</b></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 100%"><b>In addition, the North
        still seethed over British support of the Confederacy, and some,
        especially Johnson, demanded reparations. Nobody had forgotten that
        Britain had helped arm the South and even sold them warships. Other
        non-Irish Americans believed that America should include all of North
        America, a north-south version of Manifest Destiny. Finally, there were
        many angry over Canada permitting Confederate spy rings to operate
        openly in the Civil War, thus partially blaming Canada for the very
        recent assassination of Abraham Lincoln.<a style="mso-endnote-id:edn51" href="#_edn51" name="_ednref51" title><span class="MsoEndnoteReference">8</span></a></b></p>

        Roberts, a wealthy Brooklyn businessman, placed the highly respected
        Civil War General Tom Sweeny in charge of the new army, and the invasion
        was planned for the spring, 1866.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Roberts
        had even met with President Johnson regarding the attack, and Johnson
        reportedly agreed, “To recognize the accomplished facts”<a style="mso-endnote-id:edn52" href="#_edn52" name="_ednref52" title><span class="MsoEndnoteReference">9</span></a>

        foothold in the North Country.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>General
        Sweeny believed his forces could easily measure in excess of 20,000 men
        at various attack points across the 4,000-mile border, and even
        purchased three warships from the U.S. Navy. <span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;</span>The
        leading Canadian Fenian, Toronto’s Mike Murphy, convinced Roberts that
        after defeating the initial Canadian (British) defenders, thousands of
        disaffected Canadians, one third of whom were of Irish descent, would
        rise with his troops.<a style="mso-endnote-id:edn53" href="#_edn53" name="_ednref53" title><span class="MsoEndnoteReference">10</span></a></b></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 100%"><b>Tom Sweeny was a
        wonderful choice to lead the military wing after the best man for the
        job, General Phil Sheridan, decided to stay in the shadows in these
        early days. Sweeny was one of many Irish soldiers whose exploits have
        been overshadowed by their service in the Western Theatre, and not in
        the more publicized East during the war. In fact, Tom Sweeny and John
        O’Neill were more alike than perhaps they ever realized, and both have
        been relegated in history unfairly in a fragmentary fashion. Sweeny was
        fifteen years older than O’Neill, but like the younger Monaghan man,
        had wished for nothing else than a military life. Both were 5’9” and
        had black hair and dark eyes, and neither was quiet when their ire was
        raised after a drink. Sweeny, a stalwart in the Civil War, had earlier
        fought bravely in Mexico and against the Indians; rising through the
        ranks after enlistment much like O’Neill would do a decade later.<a style="mso-endnote-id:

        <p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 100%"><b>Neither man knew their
        fathers, who died in Ireland, and both arrived as the youngest children
        in their respective families. They both joined the army for an active,
        not philosophical life, seeking adventure away from the quiet home life
        their mothers had fashioned for them in the East.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
        </span>A description of Sweeny could easily pass for O’Neill.
        “Sweeny was brave, often to the point of rashness, efficient,
        resourceful, self-confident, careful of the safety and comfort of his
        men, and capable of enduring the most trying hardships. He was quick to
        damn incompetence, and quicker still to resent any slight, real or
        imaginary.”<a style="mso-endnote-id:edn55" href="#_edn55" name="_ednref55" title><span class="MsoEndnoteReference">12</span></a>
        Ironically both men joined the Nashville Fenian Circle, though there is
        no concrete evidence their paths crossed until Ridgeway.</b></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 100%"><span style="mso-spacerun:yes"><b>&nbsp;</b></span><b>There
        would be no doubt, of course, where the expansive and hard-drinking John
        O’Neill stood on the invasion issue, but a question of priorities now
        crept into the lives of Mary Ann and John O’Neill. On March 2, 1866,
        John Hugh O’Neill was born in Nashville and baptized on March 14 at
        the Catholic Cathedral. His godfather was the same George J. Macklin of
        Elizabeth, New Jersey, who had been the best man at the Colonel’s
        wedding.<a style="mso-endnote-id:edn56" href="#_edn56" name="_ednref56" title><span class="MsoEndnoteReference">13</span></a>
        George was now 21, and had moved to Nashville working as a clerk, but
        really there to fight with his uncle John.<a style="mso-endnote-id:edn57" href="#_edn57" name="_ednref57" title><span class="MsoEndnoteReference">14</span></a>
        There is no record if another Macklin or O’Neill was present at the
        baptism, but it would have been almost impossible. It must have been a
        glorious day for Mary Ann, the beginning of her life as a mother after
        arriving in America as a young child, only to see her parents die in
        California and be raised an orphan. She was educated by the Sisters of
        Charity in San Francisco, and worked as so many thousands of Irish
        immigrant girls did as domestics in the homes of wealthy American
        families, only to fall in love with a handsome fellow Irish man with a
        sense of morality, courage and conviction. Her much honored and beloved
        husband surely could feel similar but distant thoughts. A son born,
        whose middle name was in honor to the greatest Irish revolutionary
        leader of all time, Hugh O’Neill of Tyrone, <b style="mso-bidi-font-weight:normal">The</b>
        O’Neill. Most importantly, Colonel John O’Neill of the Fenian
        Brotherhood must have felt some pangs of emotion knowing he was present
        and alive at the birth of his own son, with the memory of his own birth
        and upbringing forever etched upon his mind.</b></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 100%"><b>Nonetheless, the
        Fenian invasion plan, which Colonel John O’Neill had so fervently
        prayed, one that was considered an “audacious plan”<a style="mso-endnote-id:edn58" href="#_edn58" name="_ednref58" title><span class="MsoEndnoteReference">15</span></a>
        by more than one historian, moved forward. If John O’Neill felt any
        second thoughts about leaving his newborn son, the record is silent.
        Along with his adjutants, Captains Lawrence Shields and Rudolphus
        Fitzpatrick and the men of the 13<sup>th</sup> Tennessee, O’Neill was
        ready to leave home, hearth, and even new-born, if Irish freedom was to
        be achieved.</b></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 100%"><b>On May 27, 1866,
        O’Neill left his wife and two month old son and with the 150 men of
        the 13<sup>th</sup> Tennessee boarded a train headed north, picked up
        the 17<sup>th</sup> IRA regiment under Colonel George Owen Starr at
        Louisville, then another regiment in Ohio before rolling into the
        Cleveland train depot. Wearing working clothes as a disguise, but
        fooling absolutely nobody, the Fenians, whose plans were always public
        secrets, discovered no boats, no superiors, and no orders. After waiting
        anxiously for twenty-four hours, a Sweeny cable told the four hundred to
        move to Buffalo. Upon arrival Fenian men of the Buffalo circle billeted
        them throughout the area.<a style="mso-endnote-id:edn59" href="#_edn59" name="_ednref59" title><span class="MsoEndnoteReference">16</span></a></b></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 100%"><b>The historic plan was
        already becoming a fiasco. Roberts was lost in his role as president,
        proving John Devoy correct in his assessment of the Brooklyn merchant,
        whom he described as “successful, vain, and shallow but showy.”<a style="mso-endnote-id:edn60" href="#_edn60" name="_ednref60" title><span class="MsoEndnoteReference">17</span></a>
        Newspapers throughout the country were reporting mass movements of men,
        many moving in different directions. Worse, leadership of the attack
        fell apart. General Sweeny was let down by a combination of poorly
        organized local circles and just plain bad luck. Brigadier William Lynch
        was too sick to appear and General Charles Tevis did nothing, and was
        later tried for cowardice. With his chain of command disintegrating,
        Sweeny ordered Lynch’s adjutant, Colonel Ed Sherwin, to take command,
        but he also failed to appear. Exasperated, Sweeny sent a telegram
        ordering the most senior officer in Buffalo to take charge as acting
        brigadier.</b></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 100%"><b>After five days on
        trains and in warehouses, John O’Neill was thrust into history by
        default, but as it turned out, he was a brilliant choice. O’Neill
        eagerly led the expedition across the Niagara River into Canada. The
        engaging, persuasive and impulsive O’Neill was a natural leader and a
        most loyal Fenian soldier looking for a long awaited fight. The
        Brotherhood oath was ingrained on his heart, especially the phrase, “I
        will labor with my earnest zeal for the liberation of Ireland from the
        yoke of England.”<a style="mso-endnote-id:edn61" href="#_edn61" name="_ednref61" title><span class="MsoEndnoteReference">19</span></a>
        He was proud and honored to play a supporting role.</b></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 100%"><b>The tens of thousands
        expected at the various staging points failed to show with only the 800
        soon to be led by the newly designated ‘General’ John O’Neill were
        able to cross over onto Canadian soil.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
        </span>Despite the disorganization, O’Neill and his men rose to the
        challenge. They were without maps or advance information about Canadian
        defenses. Their own attack would become more difficult; the Buffalo city
        authorities were attempting to stop Fenian movements; the Canadian
        forces were gearing up – slowly – to meet them; and worst of all,
        the <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">U.S.S. Michigan, </i>on orders
        from President Johnson,<i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal"> </i>was
        patrolling the Buffalo harbor with a U.S. Marine guard to prevent their

        <p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 100%"><b>O’Neill was thrust
        into this position and no one would have blamed him had he stood down
        – everybody else did. But his natural tendency to fight, his impulsive
        nature to make quick decisions, and the deep yearning for Irish freedom
        made his actions of the next forty-eight hours no surprise to anyone who
        knew the Monaghan born and raised John O’Neill.</b></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 100%"><b>At about midnight,
        this force now approaching about 600, made a dash for the Buffalo docks,
        boarded barges, and slipped past the <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Michigan.</i>
        They landed on Canadian soil at 3:15 a.m., the only forces of the
        Brotherhood that could later walk proudly amongst their own fellow
        Fenians, and planted the Irish flag. For the next two days, June 2<sup>nd</sup>
        and 3<sup>rd</sup>, both invaders and defenders were unanimous that
        General John O’Neill and his men performed admirably. There was no
        looting, disorder, or uncontrolled mayhem, and O’Neill is even said to
        have threatened to bayonet one soldier who tried to steal a shawl from a
        tavern. More importantly, the warlike spirit had not died out on
        O’Neill. The Fenians won the only pitched battle, later called <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">The
        Battle of Ridgeway</i>, and behaved with honor on and off the field,
        fighting and marching forty miles on empty stomachs. Casualties were
        comparatively light but definitely in favor of the invaders, with twenty
        Canadian (British) killed, 74 wounded, and twenty-two captured. The
        O’Neill forces suffered only seven killed and seventeen wounded.<a style="mso-endnote-id:edn63" href="#_edn63" name="_ednref63" title><span class="MsoEndnoteReference">21</span></a></b></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 100%"><b>Though the big picture
        was a disaster, the Fenian Brotherhood considered the small work done by
        O’Neill a “glorious” victory. John MacDonald, participant in
        Ridgeway and future Prime Minister, said of O’Neill at Ridgeway,
        “The skillful disposition he made of his forces were commensurate with
        the ability of a high-class tactician,” and added, “General
        O’Neill coolly awaited the arrival of the Canadian troops, who were
        advancing from Ridgeway totally ignorant to the fact that there was a
        lion in their path.”<a style="mso-endnote-id:edn64" href="#_edn64" name="_ednref64" title><span class="MsoEndnoteReference">22</span></a>
        On June 4, British reinforcements sealed the Canadian border and
        American forces led by General Ulysses S. Grant controlled the U.S.
        side. O’Neill gallantly gave up the fight and returned to United
        States soil. He was soon paroled after being detained on the <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Michigan</i>.
        Shocking Britain, Canada, and much of America, all returning Fenians
        were given free railroad passes back to their homes, including fifteen
        from the Nashville circle, by order of President Johnson himself.<a style="mso-endnote-id:edn65" href="#_edn65" name="_ednref65" title><span class="MsoEndnoteReference">23</span></a><span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;</span></b></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 100%"><b>When O’Neill, Owen
        Starr and other leaders of the raid were brought before the magistrate
        of Erie County, local sympathizers furnished bail and they were
        discharged to great applause in the courtroom. One individual proposed
        three cheers for O’Neill, and he received a standing ovation. When
        followed to the Mansion House, the biggest hotel in town, he was greeted
        with clamorous applause and said to the crowd assembled, “Gentlemen!
        You may not be aware that I am not a speechmaker. The only kind of
        speeches I am accustomed to making are made from the cannon’s mouth.
        Situated as I am at the present, I can only advise you to retire to your
        homes, peacefully and in an orderly manner. Good-bye!”<a style="mso-endnote-id:edn66" href="#_edn66" name="_ednref66" title><span class="MsoEndnoteReference">24</span></a>
        He left the city that night for Nashville.</b></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 100%"><b>Three facts emerged
        from this first invasion of Canada. One, the Fenian movement’s grand
        plans were reduced mightily, though the Irish vote in the United States
        was obviously too important to jail <b style="mso-bidi-font-weight:normal">anyone</b>
        just for invading another country.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Second,
        Canada realized the true danger of attack by the Irish and strengthened
        its defense systems. Third, John O’Neill was recognized as a national
        star, the man who backed the British down, if only for a moment.
        Irishmen throughout the land sang the praises of O’Neill. Indeed, his
        quiet courage and courteous manner had earned and deserved it.</b></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 100%"><b>Praise for the
        Drumgallon man by way of New Jersey was not limited to just the Fenian
        Brotherhood. Canadian John MacDonald added “The irrepressible
        O’Neill treated the captured Canadians well, and complimented them on
        their bravery and courage.”<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Upon
        disembarking from the <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Michigan, </i>in
        a move that would foreshadow O’Neill’s future intentions, the
        General shook hands with each of the twenty-two Canadian prisoners, said
        goodbye, and told them, “I’m coming back.”<a style="mso-endnote-id:edn67" href="#_edn67" name="_ednref67" title><span class="MsoEndnoteReference">25</span></a></b></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 100%"><b>When the dust settled
        and the Fenians regrouped at their annual September convention in
        Cleveland, recriminations abounded, especially between Roberts and
        Sweeny, each of who blamed the other. Roberts was further damaged when
        his role regarding the captured Fenians came to light. When the men were
        condemned to be hanged, Roberts threatened to march upon Canada with
        21,000-armed men, despite the obvious fact this non-soldier had
        orchestrated such a previous failure in June. When the British Home
        Office intervened and gently asked the sentences to be commuted rather
        than create Irish martyrs (a lesson they would forget fifty years later
        in 1916), Roberts was crushed. In a letter he wrote to prisoner Robert
        Lynch, the F.B. president said, “I regret to tell you that you are not
        going to be hanged.”<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The
        prisoner’s deaths, continued Roberts, “would make every Irishman in
        America a Fenian, and raise enough money to expel the British.”<a style="mso-endnote-id:edn68" href="#_edn68" name="_ednref68" title><span class="MsoEndnoteReference">27</span></a>
        Both thoughts must have made Lynch much more comfortable about his
        situation.</b></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 100%"><b>Only O’Neill, the
        unsuspecting hero, emerged with his reputation not only intact, but also
        increased. He was unanimously thanked in a proclamation that read,
        “General John O’Neill and the officers and men of his command
        gallantly upheld the honor of our flag and vindicated the traditional
        heroism of our race.”<a style="mso-endnote-id:edn69" href="#_edn69" name="_ednref69" title><span class="MsoEndnoteReference">28</span></a></b></p>

        from Drumgallon who didn’t want to sell groceries but was raised to
        fight the English, had partially fulfilled his grandfather’s dream,
        but he would not rest on his new laurels. After all, he was now
        ‘General John O’Neill,’ a term he would acknowledge and even
        insist on, as he returned to Nashville, where a loyal and patient Mary
        Ann waited with their three-month-old son.</b></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 100%"><b>As the thirty two year
        old son of the widow Catherine O’Neill held his baby in his arms, some
        Americans, maybe friends like President Andrew Johnson, perhaps even
        family in Elizabeth, New Jersey, may have wondered if this sudden fame
        would change the measure of the man they loved. The British government
        didn’t give a damn about John O’Neill’s celebrity – they
        wondered only if he would ever unmask their secret Fenian spy, John
        O’Neill’s most loyal friend and chief aide, Henri Le Caron.</b></p>

        John O’Neill took the long weary train ride back from Buffalo to
        Nashville in early June 1866, he was no doubt depressed at the overall
        result of the invasion he had invested so much time, energy, and money
        over the past year, little could he have guessed the next four years of
        his life “General O’Neill” would be embraced by the Irish in
        America as a hero, the herald of Fenian republicanism, and indeed by
        some as the most recognizable symbol of Irishness in the United States.<a style="mso-endnote-id:edn70" href="#_edn70" name="_ednref70" title><span class="MsoEndnoteReference">1</span></a></font></b></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 100%"><b><font size="3">The
        latter half of 1866 saw the story of John O’Neill, hero of Ridgeway,
        spread across the nation like wildfire. He was covered by newspapers
        nationwide, in demand as a speaker in small towns as well as big cities
        across the country. Though O’Neill admitted to not being “a
        speech-maker” after Ridgeway, he would become very proficient, and
        soon able to bring thousands to their feet with ease.<a style="mso-endnote-id:

        <p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 100%"><b><font size="3">At the
        annual Fenian Convention in Cleveland in 1866, O’Neill was not only
        praised but also appointed Inspector-General of the Brotherhood. This
        would be just the beginning of the rise of the public ‘General’ John
        O’Neill, a role he soon embraced. But with the praise came the
        criticism, and nobody was a bigger enemy of the Irish than the <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">New
        York Times.</i> A June 2, 1866 article called the Ridgeway victory
        “just a deserted dunghill,” and added, “The Irish were not heroes,
        unless they were heroes of the same stamp who bravely led the retreat at
        Bull Run, and who helped make up the great army of bounty jumpers. These
        people are the curse of the American society.”<a style="mso-endnote-id:edn72" href="#_edn72" name="_ednref72" title><span class="MsoEndnoteReference">3</span></a></font></b></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 100%"><b><font size="3">But as
        O’Neill was the darling of the invasion, the racist paper especially

        a year, the Fenians had enough of William Roberts and the one-armed
        General Tom Sweeny. In a classic case of American ‘what have you done
        for me lately?’ they overwhelmingly elected General John C. O’Neill
        the President of the Fenian Brotherhood at the convention of 1867.<a style="mso-endnote-id:edn74" href="#_edn74" name="_ednref74" title><span class="MsoEndnoteReference">5</span></a>
        Sweeny, never a politician, in particular was upset, and issued a report
        for the failures of the invasion and then walked away from the Fenian

        Nashville was soon replaced by Washington D.C. as the new O’Neill
        home, a place John could more easily run the Fenian organization, as
        well as improve his business skills, the real estate agency having
        failed, due in no small measure to O’Neill’s neglect, first as a
        Fenian soldier, later as a Fenian politician. During the next four years
        the O’Neill’s would live off the Fenian Brotherhood, sometimes

        <p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 100%"><b><font size="3">In
        Buffalo in the summer of 1868, the site just two years previous of the
        Fenians contradictory victory and ignominious defeat, the F.B.
        convention, led by the General, unanimously passed resolutions “to
        place an army in the field and for the immediate commencement of the
        fight for the liberation of Ireland.”<a style="mso-endnote-id:edn80" href="#_edn80" name="_ednref80" title><span class="MsoEndnoteReference">11</span></a>
        One month later, in August, Mary Ella O’Neill, John and Mary Ann’s
        second child, was born in Washington. Her godfather was P.J. Meehan, the
        owner-editor of the <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Irish American
        </i>newspaper in New York City, the most powerful voice in Irish
        America. Margaret Lackey, wife of the prominent Virginian James Lackey,
        was Mary Ella’s godmother. Meehan, like all of O’Neill’s family,
        was also from New Jersey, making his home in Jersey City. Once again,
        John O’Neill bypassed his brother Bernard and other relatives from
        Elizabeth, fueling speculation that either the relationship between the
        now famous General O’Neill and his family was strained or celebrity
        status had changed the Fenian Brotherhood’s chief.<a style="mso-endnote-id:edn81" href="#_edn81" name="_ednref81" title><span class="MsoEndnoteReference">12</span></a></font></b></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 100%"><b><font size="3">Unknown
        to all, Mary Ella’s birth would signal the zenith of the O’Neill
        success. Though John was still in control of the F.B., politics had
        inevitably become a major factor in his life, much like it had Roberts,
        O’Mahony, Meehan, Stephens and dozens of others. Though now a
        proficient speaker, O’Neill was never cut out to be a politician, his
        rashness and fighting style not suited to the backroom wheeling and
        dealing of 19<sup>th</sup> century Irish-American politics. In order to
        secure the 1868 presidency, the soldier from Monaghan formed an alliance
        with Philadelphia businessman James Gibbons, the ‘Old Man’ of the
        Brotherhood and well respected by all sides of Fenians. Gibbons, was
        selected as second in command, and he successfully finessed O’Neill
        into having Gibbon’s own Philadelphia soldier hero named Secretary of
        War, and thus eliminating an O’Neill lightweight crony. General
        Michael Kerwin was, like O’Neill, a bona fide fighting professional,
        with a serious Civil War resume who had commanded a brigade of cavalry
        in the late war under Sheridan. This selection by Gibbons of Kerwin
        became the fulcrum in a split between O’Neill and his vice-president,
        never to be repaired. Meehan would compound O’Neill’s inability to
        govern by siding with the Gibbons wing, godfather or not.<a style="mso-endnote-id:edn82" href="#_edn82" name="_ednref82" title><span class="MsoEndnoteReference">13</span></a></font></b></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 100%"><b><font size="3">O’Neill
        was said to have been jealous of Kerwin, a mirror image of O’Neill as
        a soldier, with an even greater pedigree, and it has been suggested
        O’Neill saw in Kerwin a threat to his own eventual leadership, an
        unfounded concern. Some in the F.B., despite O’Neill’s apparent
        popularity, were beginning to question his compulsive confidence and his
        single-minded wish to fight, and saw instead his behavior as arrogant
        and manipulative.<a style="mso-endnote-id:edn83" href="#_edn83" name="_ednref83" title><span class="MsoEndnoteReference">14</span></a></font></b></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 100%"><b><font size="3">Cracks
        were also evident in the organizations financial statements. At one
        point in 1868 O’Neill asked for a $1 donation across the country among
        Fenian friends, members, and sympathizers. Always the optimist, he
        thought the appeal would add a million or more to the F.B. coffers, but
        he was shocked when only $8,000 was raised, hardly enough to invade a
        village, much less Canada. In October of 1868, the Fenian reserves were
        at about $20,000, but by the following April, 1869, there was only
        $3,800.<a style="mso-endnote-id:edn84" href="#_edn84" name="_ednref84" title><span class="MsoEndnoteReference">15</span></a></font></b></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 100%"><b><font size="3">There
        is little doubt that over the past two years O’Neill’s ego had
        grown, and he expected unquestioning loyalty from all Fenian camps.
        Within a short year, this flaw in O’Neill’s leadership had become a
        chasm, and Gibbons called a meeting in New York in February 1870 to cut
        off what many believed was O’Neill’s precipitous charge toward a
        second invasion.</font></b></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 100%"><b><font size="3">What
        had begun as a political spate now turned ugly, as O’Neill’s
        attempted appointment of James Keenan as Secretary of Affairs was
        rejected, led by the voice of Meehan, O’Neill’s former great friend
        and godfather to his daughter a year prior. When Keenan heard Meehan
        call him simply a crony of O’Neill in Fenian Headquarters, Keenan
        followed the editor to the street and shot him in the back of the head.
        Amazingly, Meehan survived and carried the bullet in his head until he
        died in 1906 at 74, still a prominent and respected journalist and Irish
        rebel. Keenan was sentenced to ten years at Sing-Sing, and though the
        Limerick born Meehan helped secure him a pardon after five years, Keenan
        went insane and died soon after his release.<a style="mso-endnote-id:edn85" href="#_edn85" name="_ednref85" title><span class="MsoEndnoteReference">16</span></a></font></b></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 100%"><b><font size="3">The
        incident clearly hurt O’Neill’s standing among the Brotherhood, and
        soon many, urged to or not by Gibbons and Meehan, began questioning
        other aspects of his leadership, in particular his financial
        expenditures. John was not the businessman his brother Bernard was, had
        failed in at least two ventures, and had been living solely on the
        Fenian dole for several years. Despite being paid an outrageous $2,000
        annual salary as president, O’Neill would not be the first politician
        to live perhaps a bit over his head, but guilty or not, the General was
        backed into a corner. O’Neill was also damaged by his love of a drop,
        and several leading Brotherhood figures were shocked at an April, 1870
        strategy meeting at which O’Neill “appeared awfully drunk.”<a style="mso-endnote-id:edn86" href="#_edn86" name="_ednref86" title><span class="MsoEndnoteReference">17</span></a></font></b></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 100%"><b><font size="3">If he
        battled his Fenian foes, he surely would come out a loser to the savvy
        Gibbons wing, thus destroying his reputation – or worse. O’Neill
        realized he was at his best as a soldier, and his only chance was to
        invade, fight, and win. After all, the small attack at Ridgeway had
        brought him national acclaim for four years. Victory was the great
        equalizer, and should he be successful in Canada, his place in history
        would be secure.</font></b></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 100%"><b><font size="3">But the
        Fenian Senate rejected the General when he called for an attack, and
        feeling desperate, O’Neill called his Fenian Military Officers
        Committee together in Troy, New York and simply told them he was
        authorizing an invasion. Whatever chance at keeping the F.B. together
        exploded, and the Senate expelled O’Neill as their president.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
        </span>General John O’Neill, realizing all his options but one had
        evaporated, held his own small convention and compulsively formed
        another branch of the Fenian Brotherhood.<a style="mso-endnote-id:edn87" href="#_edn87" name="_ednref87" title><span class="MsoEndnoteReference">18</span></a>
        Under this banner, he launched the second invasion, frantic but always
        confidant. It would be an almost impossible task, but if John O’Neill
        had any chance of fulfilling old dreams and new hopes, he would be
        doomed by the most damning figure in Irish history – an informer.</font></b></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 100%"><b><font size="3">Carrying
        the unlikely moniker of Henri Le Caron, the Englishman Thomas Bellis
        Beach had worked his way to America, fought in the Civil War, changed
        his name, and married a Catholic girl of Irish descent in Nashville,
        where he befriended the Monaghan soldier John O’Neill in 1865. Through
        an unusual series of letters home to his father in England, Le Caron
        became a paid informer against the Fenian Brotherhood for the British
        Home Office in 1867, shortly after Ridgeway, and for the rest of his
        life General John O’Neill’s every move would be known in both London
        and Canada. O’Neill was thus, at the apogee of his celebrity,
        unknowingly being squeezed both by his Fenian opponents and the spy he
        considered his most loyal adjutant.<a style="mso-endnote-id:edn88" href="#_edn88" name="_ednref88" title><span class="MsoEndnoteReference">19</span></a>
        One O’Neill biographer would claim that “O’Neill quarreled with
        his advisers, and as a consequence, attempted a raid on May 25, 1870,
        and only a handful of Fenians joined him.”<a style="mso-endnote-id:edn89" href="#_edn89" name="_ednref89" title><span class="MsoEndnoteReference">20</span></a>
        This was a charitable view to O’Neill’s problems, the truth being
        that all the F.B., but in particular, John O’Neill, accepted Le Caron,
        despite his distinct British accent that led some Chicago Fenians to
        suspect his pedigree as early as 1867.<a style="mso-endnote-id:edn90" href="#_edn90" name="_ednref90" title><span class="MsoEndnoteReference">21</span></a></font></b></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 100%"><b><font size="3">The
        Canadians, who paid him, were distrustful of Le Caron. John MacDonald,
        as Prime Minister, called him “nothing but a little draper,”<a style="mso-endnote-id:edn91" href="#_edn91" name="_ednref91" title><span class="MsoEndnoteReference">22</span></a>
        a rather accurate description. Everybody thought him ‘odd’ but he
        was a good spy, and from 1867 until well after O’Neill’s death and
        into the 1890’s, he fooled everybody, much to the chagrin of Irish
        republicanism in Ireland and the United States. After the publication of
        his memoirs when he was ‘outed’ in 1890, several Fenian historians
        have correctly pointed out the obvious exaggerations, distortions, and
        lies detailed in Le Caron’s memoirs, but there can be no doubt he
        damaged the organization, and was responsible in large measure for the
        sudden fall of John O’Neill.<a style="mso-endnote-id:edn92" href="#_edn92" name="_ednref92" title><span class="MsoEndnoteReference">23</span></a></font></b></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 100%"><b><font size="3">Disastrously
        for O’Neill he allowed Le Caron access to all Fenian correspondence,
        and as early as June 1868 when O’Neill met with his old friend from
        Tennessee, President Andrew Johnson, he brought Le Caron along and
        introduced him as ‘Major’ Le Caron. For years afterward, the Fenian
        Brotherhood, the British Home Office, and the Canadian government paid
        the ugly, odd spy. Ironically, a week after meeting with President
        Johnson, O’Neill sent a missive to each of the 524 American Fenian
        Circles, with a warning “to look out for spies.” Many Fenians were
        paranoid about the issue of infiltration, but none ever took a serious
        look at Le Caron.<a style="mso-endnote-id:edn93" href="#_edn93" name="_ednref93" title><span class="MsoEndnoteReference">24</span></a></font></b></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 100%"><b><font size="3">In May
        1869, Major Le Caron was appointed Inspector-General of the Fenians; the
        same post two years earlier that had spring boarded John O’Neill to
        stardom. This enabled the Englishman to supervise the acquisition of all
        weapons and drops, and from this date forward the Canadian government
        knew where every single rifle, handgun, and bullet was stored. By the
        spring of 1870, however, it didn’t matter, as O’Neill, backed into a
        corner, raised a few hundred loyal men and attempted a raid from Eccles
        Hill, Vermont, just over the border from Frelighsburg, Quebec. If the
        first invasion of 1866 was audacious, this second one was hopeless, if
        not ridiculous. The Canadians, of course, were waiting in ambush, thanks
        to Le Caron. As the first vanguard of O’Neill’s new Fenian group
        advanced toward the bridge at the border, the Canucks opened fire and a
        rout ensued. It was over so suddenly U.S. marshals calmly arrested John
        O’Neill, who never shied away from leading the action, before he could
        even take the field.<a style="mso-endnote-id:

        half a dozen other wealthy celebrities were all from out of state, bail

        Fenian movement upon Canada has been the topic of conversation during
        the week. Small bodies of men have gathered on our northern frontier,
        and five hundred under command of General O’Neill, while advancing
        from Franklin, Vt., were fired upon by some Canadian militia. The fire

        many of them eagerly turned their faces towards home and were franked

        promptitude of President Grant, in issuing the proclamation elicits
        praise, but the London Times eagerly calls on the Canadians to raise the
        Union Jack flag, and spare none of the marauders. In government circles
        in Washington the whole affair is looked upon as a device by the Fenian
        leaders to tickle more money of the rank and file of the Irish laboring
        population of the country, and we are inclined to look upon it in that
        light.<a style="mso-endnote-id:edn104" href="#_edn104" name="_ednref104" title><span class="MsoEndnoteReference">35</span></a><o:p>

        <p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 100%"><b><font size="3">Even
        while in prison, O’Neill recognized the need to get his side of the
        story to the Irish-American public, and he resorted to what he did best
        – go on the offensive. Helped by the New York publisher John J.
        Foster, O’Neill published a lengthy 62-page defense tract outlining
        all of his actions from Ridgeway to his release from jail. He attacked
        the entire Gibbons wing of the Fenian Brotherhood and was vehemently
        bitter towards P.J. Meehan. O’Neill described the editor as “The
        evil genius who went to work in his own particular style to foil my
        efforts by seeking to destroy my influence with the Brotherhood and ruin
        my character.”<a style="mso-endnote-id:edn105" href="#_edn105" name="_ednref105" title><span class="MsoEndnoteReference">36</span></a></font></b></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 100%"><b><font size="3">O’Neill
        also deflected any issue of monetary malfeasance, which had been
        whispered about but never proved, by saying “It is a well known fact
        that since 1868, the greater portion of the funds of the Fenian
        Brotherhood had passed through the hands of Mr. Meehan, as he had entire
        control of the payments made for arms.”<a style="mso-endnote-id:
edn106" href="#_edn106" name="_ednref106" title><span class="MsoEndnoteReference">37</span></a>
        But whispers are dangerous, and many believed O’Neill guilty - of
        something. Meehan was never investigated.</font></b></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 100%"><b><font size="3">In the
        course of his detailed pamphlet, John O’Neill mentioned every person
        and organization who had pledged or given money for bail or family
        sustenance even if they had contributed as little as five dollars. There
        was no mention however, of anyone from Elizabeth, New Jersey named
        Macklin or O’Neill. Either O’Neill was one of the most private men
        in the world when it came to family, or something was <span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;</span>clearly
        amiss. Only a year before the raid in Vermont, Uncle John Macklin had
        been the largest single contributor to a fundraiser at Saint Mary’s
        Church, donating $255, a spirited amount that would easily pay for a
        home in 1870. There was also no mention ever in O’Neill’s
        correspondence of his brother Bernard, who had contributed $150 dollars
        to the same Saint Mary fundraiser.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In
        the entire city of Elizabeth, the donations of John and Bernard were in
        the top five givers.<a style="mso-endnote-id:edn107" href="#_edn107" name="_ednref107" title><span class="MsoEndnoteReference">38</span></a>
        Not a dime, apparently, went to John O’Neill, unless given very
        privately. Meanwhile Thomas Beach, alias Henri Le Caron, quickly and
        quietly absented himself from Vermont and returned to his family in
        Illinois, nobody the wiser. Just as quickly, John O’Neill left Vermont
        with Mary Ann and the two children. He had promised Judge Woodruff and
        all of Irish-America he would desist from any future thoughts of
        military action against Canada, “As any further attempt would be
        criminal.”<a style="mso-endnote-id:edn108" href="#_edn108" name="_ednref108" title><span class="MsoEndnoteReference">39</span></a>
        John O’Neill seemed finished with the Fenian movement; he was neither
        the first nor the last, but the question Mary Ann must have asked
        herself was “What will we do now?” John O’Neill was only
        thirty-five years old, had been in the spotlight for almost a decade –
        and liked it.</font></b></p>

        <p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 100%"><b><font size="3">General
        John O’Neill passed the early months of 1871 licking his wounds with
        his wife Mary Ann and their two children, John Hugh, four, and Mary
        Ella, two. Embarrassed, his leadership of the Fenian Brotherhood
        stripped, his income gone, many observers may have expected the proud
        and egotistical O’Neill to crawl into an historical hole, never to be
        seen or heard again. In fact, he did not even leave the Brotherhood.</font></b></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 100%"><b><font size="3">Spurred
        on by the winter publication of his four-year account of his Fenian
        history, written in a Vermont jail, the general clung to his Fenian
        membership by his fingernails. Joined by his most loyal followers,
        O’Neill confidently switched allegiances, and retained a place in the
        minority Savage ‘wing’ of the Brotherhood. The Fenian leadership,
        despite their wish to isolate and marginalize the hero of Ridgeway,
        simply could not ignore O’Neill’s continued appeal throughout Irish
        America, where he remained extremely popular.<a style="mso-endnote-id:edn109" href="#_edn109" name="_ednref109" title><span class="MsoEndnoteReference">1</span></a></font></b></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 100%"><b><font size="3">How
        John supported his family, and what plans he had for the future are
        unknown, but after departing from Vermont there is some evidence the
        O’Neill’s relocated temporarily to New York. Now 36 years old, a
        career change was in order for the twice defeated but still widely
        admired ‘General.’ When William Roberts left the Fenians, he retired
        to Long Island and lived comfortably off his contacts and business.
        Former General Tom Sweeny resigned from the Fenians to keep his benefits
        and pension, and also enjoyed a post Brotherhood life. John O’Mahony,
        the oldest Fenian, returned to New York and lived a quiet life until he
        died at age 61 in 1877. Even Henri Le Caron could be found living a
        family life of sorts in the Chicago suburbs, no doubt thinking his
        harried four-year spying career was over.<a style="mso-endnote-id:edn110" href="#_edn110" name="_ednref110" title><span class="MsoEndnoteReference">2</span></a></font></b></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 100%"><b><font size="3">It
        should have been an easy transition for the devout Catholic O’Neill.
        He was still young, had a growing family as well as a successful and
        large extended family only fifteen miles away in Elizabeth, New Jersey
        that was not dependent upon him. Despite the misguided defeat at Eccles
        Hill, John O’Neill was still revered by the general Irish population,
        and numerous well-connected patrons throughout the country were in
        position to ease him through his early middle age. One thing was certain
        – the John O’Neill military career was over. Though like many
        ex-soldiers, O’Neill could and would carry his rank until death, both
        this country and Ireland would not need his military services. The
        United States would be at peace for more than thirty years, still
        reeling from the bloody Civil War; the 1867 miniature uprising in
        Ireland ended any future thought of armed rebellion until 1916; and most
        importantly, O’Neill himself had told Judge Woodruff in Vermont,
        “Any further (military) attempt would be criminal, and as far as my
        influence goes, I will use it to convince the Irish people in America
        that any further attempt would be futile.”<a style="mso-endnote-id:
edn111" href="#_edn111" name="_ednref111" title><span class="MsoEndnoteReference">3</span></a>
        Finally, the General told his own Fenian Brotherhood upon his return
        from prison he would have nothing to do with any Canadian invasion
        attempts when he published the above quote in his manifesto.</font></b></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 100%"><b><font size="3">But out
        of the far West came a lone shadowy rider with similar exaggerated
        dreams of Irish freedom. Though rejected by every sensible government
        and Fenian official in Washington and New York, the Sligo born William
        Bernard O’Donoghue would capture the soul of John Charles O’Neill.
        As a result all promises to Judge Woodruff, the F.B., and Mary Ann and
        the children were turned to dust. Any hope Catherine O’Neill may have
        had for her youngest child, the one she so mistakenly had left in
        Ireland the longest, that he would return to a life of normalcy,
        disappeared when John and W.B. O’Donoghue shared their first drink.</font></b></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 100%"><b><font size="3">The
        story of this third ’Fenian’ invasion of Canada is the one least
        covered by historians, but it may reveal the most about John O’Neill.
        First, it was not, unlike 1866 or 1870, a Fenian directed fight, though
        it has often been depicted as such.</font></b></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 100%"><b><font size="3">W.B.
        O’Donoghue burst unto the North American scene as a 25 year old in the
        Red River area of present day Manitoba, where he had been studying for
        the priesthood.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In 1868, as
        John O’Neill was preparing for a second term as Fenian Brotherhood
        president, O’Donoghue became entranced by Louis Riel’s ‘Red River
        Independence Movement’, and soon became a member of his cabinet. The
        Metis, a mixed race of European and Native American people, were seeking
        independence from the majority English speaking Dominion, and Riel, who
        was also part Irish, was their unquestioned leader.<a style="mso-endnote-id:
edn112" href="#_edn112" name="_ednref112" title><span class="MsoEndnoteReference">4</span></a></font></b></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 100%"><b><font size="3">Historian
        Roy Johnson portrayed O’Donoghue in terms that could have made him
        O’Neill’s twin. “O’Donoghue,” said Johnson, “was an eloquent
        speaker (French and English) and an able organizer. O’Donoghue was
        fiery-tempered, proud, and egotistical.”<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
        </span>Though not a Fenian himself, he was attracted to its principles.
        Like O’Neill, the good-looking O’Donoghue easily won loyal followers
        among the people of the west. The most troubling attribute the two men
        shared, however, was a “characteristic propensity” for impulsive
        action.<a style="mso-endnote-id:edn113" href="#_edn113" name="_ednref113" title><span class="MsoEndnoteReference">5</span></a></font></b></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 100%"><b><font size="3">In
        September 1870, at the direction of Metis leader Riel, O’Donoghue was
        dispatched to Washington with one assignment. He was to ask President
        Grant if he would appeal to the Queen to intercede in the dispute
        between the Canadian government and the Metis. O’Donoghue may have
        done so, but he also added a plea of his own for United States
        annexation of the western Canadian province. Grant, and every other
        Washington politician the irrepressible O’Donoghue reached, rejected
        both ideas without discussion.<a style="mso-endnote-id:edn114" href="#_edn114" name="_ednref114" title><span class="MsoEndnoteReference">6</span></a></font></b></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 100%"><b><font size="3">Undeterred,
        O’Donoghue travelled north to New York City and pitched his idea of
        annexation to the Fenian Senate, asking for arms, men, and military
        assistance, in effect, an army. With the memory of Eccles Hill only
        months old, the Irishman from the northwest was turned down flat, the
        Fenians finished forever with invasion plans in North America. He
        returned to Riel and the Red River with nothing, but doggedly returned
        to New York in the spring of 1871, and again his appeals were rejected
        – with one exception. John O’Neill, only four months removed from a
        Vermont prison, was entranced by O’Donoghue’s eloquence,
        persistence, and promises of glory.<a style="mso-endnote-id:edn115" href="#_edn115" name="_ednref115" title><span class="MsoEndnoteReference">7</span></a></font></b></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 100%"><b><font size="3">Once
        the entire Fenian organization realized that O’Neill was in the
        O’Donoghue camp, the General resigned completely from the Brotherhood
        he had sworn allegiance to six years before in Nashville. A deal was
        struck absolving the F.B. from any blame forthcoming between the two
        simpatico dreamers.<a style="mso-endnote-id:edn116" href="#_edn116" name="_ednref116" title><span class="MsoEndnoteReference">8</span></a>
        One historian says John O’Neill apparently saw this as a final
        opportunity to “strike a blow against Great Britain.”<a style="mso-endnote-id:edn117" href="#_edn117" name="_ednref117" title><span class="MsoEndnoteReference">9</span></a>
        But this is simplistic, and O’Neill did not behave like a sound
        military commander when he also boasted he could conduct the entire
        campaign alone. In truth, General John O’Neill had finally done to
        himself what the leadership of the Fenian Brotherhood could never do –
        rid themselves of the man who was once their brightest star.</font></b></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 100%"><b><font size="3">The two
        Irishmen headed west, with much to accomplish for their planned attack
        against Manitoba, just south of the Red River. Presumably O’Neill
        began this trip alone, as Mary Ann and the children went to Elizabeth
        and moved in with John’s mother Catherine and sister Mary.<a style="mso-endnote-id:edn118" href="#_edn118" name="_ednref118" title><span class="MsoEndnoteReference">10</span></a></font></b></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 100%"><b><font size="3">The
        prospects for success were slim. O’Neill had no backing from the
        Fenians and O’Donoghue had now split with Riel, who also thought this
        invasion concept was beyond the pale. Instead, Riel turned and notified
        his English speaking Canadian enemies, and said he would remain loyal to
        the government, which he did, at least temporarily. <a style="mso-endnote-id:edn119" href="#_edn119" name="_ednref119" title><span class="MsoEndnoteReference">11</span></a>Despite
        the odds, both men were convinced they would be successful, “like dogs
        barking at the moon.”<a style="mso-endnote-id:edn120" href="#_edn120" name="_ednref120" title><span class="MsoEndnoteReference">12</span></a></font></b></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 100%"><b><font size="3">O’Neill
        had never been to the high plains of the northwest, and O’Donoghue had
        no experience as a soldier.<a style="mso-endnote-id:edn121" href="#_edn121" name="_ednref121" title><span class="MsoEndnoteReference">13</span></a>
        Compounding the situation, O’Neill stopped in Lockport, Illinois and
        visited his “most loyal and supportive” friend, Henri Le Caron. Even
        the heinous British spy was incredulous after O’Neill arrived and
        explained his mission. O’Neill asked for Le Caron’s help in
        acquiring arms. The odd little man, always on the lookout for cash,
        agreed to give O’Neill 400 modern breechloaders plus ammunition the
        former Inspector General had stashed away in a Fenian secret cache. The
        spy then wrote immediately to the Canadians, expecting, and receiving, a
        check for the information provided. This new escapade of O’Neill’s
        was so bizarre even Le Caron turned down an invitation to participate,
        so O’Neill and O’Donoghue continued northwest.<a style="mso-endnote-id:edn122" href="#_edn122" name="_ednref122" title><span class="MsoEndnoteReference">14</span></a></font></b></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 100%"><b><font size="3">Unaware
        the Canadians were now alerted, O’Neill and O’Donoghue headed for
        Saint Paul, Minnesota to raise money and men. For several months they
        gave impassioned speeches, passed around the collection plate, and used
        the prestige of O’Neill’s name to attract recruits. In what should
        have been an eye-opening omen, General John O’Neill left Minnesota and
        headed for Canada at the end of September with 35 men. By October 4,
        this force of untrained men, mostly the unemployed from St. Paul, was
        just south of the border near Pembina, North Dakota.<a style="mso-endnote-id:edn123" href="#_edn123" name="_ednref123" title><span class="MsoEndnoteReference">15</span></a></font></b></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 100%"><b><font size="3">Before
        deciding to invade Canada for the third time in five years with less
        than a stellar and committed laughingstock of an army, did O’Neill
        realize that American law enforcement and Canadian troops were prepared
        for them, and worse, that both the United States and Canada had agreed
        to let American soldiers seize any troublemakers? If so, it did not stop

        result of the raid was sadly predictable and ludicrous, though it would
        eventually enable the Canadians to make Manitoba a province sooner
        rather than later. O’Neill’s men captured a Hudson Bay Trading Post
        plus two deserted log buildings, only to discover much later they were
        still in the United States, and not in Canada. The approaching U.S. army
        under Captain Wheaton promptly dispersed the ‘invaders’ from Fort
        Pembina. Wheaton arrested a dozen men plus O’Neill, while another two
        dozen freedom fighters scattered hither and yon, leaving 300 stands of
        arms and 7,000 rounds of ammunition.<a style="mso-endnote-id:edn125" href="#_edn125" name="_ednref125" title><span class="MsoEndnoteReference">17</span></a></font></b></p>

        the Canadian authorities, where he was promptly jailed. When the
        ‘battle’ was over, there had been no shots fired by the O’Neill
        forces, no fatalities, and no injuries except the military reputation of
        General John O’Neill.<a style="mso-endnote-id:edn126" href="#_edn126" name="_ednref126" title><span class="MsoEndnoteReference">18</span></a></font></b></p>

        of the two Irish dreamers. After the initial embarrassment of
        surrendering his magnificent sword when arrested, and despite all that
        had led him to this lonely place, John O’Neill remained unchanged. In

        Ann and the children. In a scene he had visited before, the General had
        no job and no home, but found himself still the darling of a large
        percentage of the American Irish community. <span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;</span>Many
        Irish-Americans read the press stories on the botched invasions, not
        with regret or apology, but as attacks motivated as prejudice against
        their Irish race.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In this
        contrary way, O’Neill was thus further exalted, especially by the poor
        and downtrodden. Several press accounts of the Dakota raid praised
        O’Neill’s bearing, personality, and his unrelenting nationalist
        persuasion.<a style="mso-endnote-id:edn131" href="#_edn131" name="_ednref131" title><span class="MsoEndnoteReference">1</span></a>
        After he was released from arrest with all charges forgotten, many were
        even convinced of the General’s public invincibility. John O’Neill,
        a fine soldier, had by now become a brilliant self-promoter.</b></font></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 100%"><font size="3"><b>Most
        reports on O’Neill’s life have him abandoning his military persona
        and starting a new life as a colonizer of the downtrodden eastern Irish
        for the beauty of the West, in particular, Nebraska. One 1919
        commentator said “O’Neill turned his attention to the material
        welfare of his race, guiding them from the squalor of the mining zones
        of Scranton and Calumet to the broad fertile prairies of Nebraska.”<a style="mso-endnote-id:edn132" href="#_edn132" name="_ednref132" title><span class="MsoEndnoteReference">2</span></a>

        Even a third has claimed the General “conceived the idea of
        establishing the Irish resettlement while a prisoner in Vermont.”<a style="mso-endnote-id:edn134" href="#_edn134" name="_ednref134" title><span class="MsoEndnoteReference">4</span></a></b></font></p>

        lecture circuit. He would not be unique, as many G.A.R ex-officers did
        the same. Fellow New Jerseyan and ex-cavalry officer Judson Kilpatrick,
        a friend of O’Neill’s, made a very fine living traveling the country
        in 1871 and 1872 with a speech titled <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:

        lecture series on ‘<i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Incidents and
        Battle Scenes of the Rebellion</i>.’ The success of the lecherous,
        ugly little Kilpatrick, who was earning thousands for just a few talks,
        may have inspired the more appealing O’Neill, who had been a polished
        speaker for years.<a style="mso-endnote-id:edn135" href="#_edn135" name="_ednref135" title><span class="MsoEndnoteReference">5</span></a></b></font></p>

        were found. A year and a half into his career as a professional speaker
        on Irish history, the country became mired in a serious economic
        depression, and O’Neill realized his lectures would not be sufficient
        to support his lifestyle. Indeed, there are signs that O’Neill was
        struggling. In a positive newspaper article from The Muscantine, Iowa,<i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">
        Evening Press </i>of June 25, 1872 commented, “When he embraced
        Fenianism, General O’Neill was possessed of a fine competency, which
        he spent in the cause, and now, though broken in health and property, he
        still is sanguine of better days for Ireland and Irishmen.”<a style="mso-endnote-id:edn139" href="#_edn139" name="_ednref139" title><span class="MsoEndnoteReference">9</span></a></font></b></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height:150%"><b><font size="3">While on
        tour in November 1873, he met with Mayo born Patrick Fahy, a land
        speculator interested in a town site in Holt County, Nebraska. Until
        this meeting, there is no public record that shows General John
        O’Neill had any interest in Irish resettlement, only in Irish freedom
        fighting. In fact, it was known in Nebraska that the General had no
        income and needed money, and he eagerly agreed to work as a land agent
        for Fahy for a salary of $600 on condition he would work on migration to
        Holt County among the Irish.<a style="mso-endnote-id:edn140" href="#_edn140" name="_ednref140" title><span class="MsoEndnoteReference">10</span></a></font></b></p>

        coming to terms with Fahy, O’Neill immediately visited the northern
        Nebraska location and the site met with his approval, whereupon he set
        off for the East to fulfill his contract. O’Neill, the eternal
        optimist, may have thought this would be a temporary and quick job, but
        he would work at it for six years with his accustomed zeal, and it would
        eventually kill him.</font></b></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height:150%"><b><font size="3">O’Neill
        set up a company he called ‘<i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">O’Neill’s
        Irish American Colonies,’</i> and he continued his speaking tours
        predominately in Pennsylvania, Michigan, Indiana, and Illinois, but
        turned down no invitation anywhere. The indefatigable forty year old was
        still and always, an Irish nationalist first, and everything else,
        second. From December 1874 until his stroke three years later, O’Neill
        is said to have spoken to a hundred audiences, from New Jersey to
        Michigan.<a style="mso-endnote-id:edn141" href="#_edn141" name="_ednref141" title><span class="MsoEndnoteReference">11</span></a>
        His new lectures, however, were exactly like the old ones, with one
        small addendum. O’Neill would open with a history of his time with the
        Fenians, discuss each ‘invasion’ of Canada, defend his strategies
        and honesty, castigate his “cowardly” enemies, and vowed to continue
        the fight to free Ireland. The last ten minutes of an hour talk

        worked his colonization plans foremost in the Pennsylvania mining
        districts of Scranton and Pottstown, Pa. and the copper fields of
        Hancock and Red Jacket, Michigan, where economic depression, combined
        with awful working conditions, saw hunger and poverty reach astounding

        One report showed fully one third of Pennsylvania workers “idle” and
        O’Neill’s pitch surely made sense to many. The General offered
        settlers wonderful terms of free title of “eighty acres within twenty
        miles of a railroad, or one hundred sixty acres if outside for only
        $18,” provided it be settled for five years. He asked in one
        questionnaire published in various newspapers, “Why are you content to
        work on the public projects and at coal mining when you might in a few
        years own farms of your own and become wealthy and influential
        people?” But despite the promise of a better life with almost no down
        payment, relocation cost money. O’Neill admitted that a family should
        not go west without $500 in capital, single men less, a considerable if
        not impossible task in the midst of a national depression.<a style="mso-endnote-id:edn147" href="#_edn147" name="_ednref147" title><span class="MsoEndnoteReference">17</span></a></font></b></p>

        kept O’Neill afloat, and six months after taking on the project,
        General John O’Neill ushered in his first colony, all Irish, on May
        12, 1874. Thirteen men, two women, and three children arrived in the
        middle of a vast prairie – and nothing else. No trees, no railroad, no
        structures, just miles and miles of tall grass. By October, only five
        men were left, though they were buoyed by the arrival in November of
        three more Pennsylvania miners.<a style="mso-endnote-id:edn148" href="#_edn148" name="_ednref148" title><span class="MsoEndnoteReference">18</span></a></font></b></p>

        Gregory Passewitz pointed out in <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">O’Neill,
        Nebraska, The First Quarter Century, </i>“The town of O’Neill had no
        special drawing card to lure settlers. There were no valuable mineral
        deposits, the land was hard to farm and suffered from soil erosion and
        drought, and access to the region was by ox-drawn wagons. In short,
        there was no easy road to success except the lure of cheap land and the
        idea of a new fresh start in life.”<a style="mso-endnote-id:edn149" href="#_edn149" name="_ednref149" title><span class="MsoEndnoteReference">19</span></a></font></b></p>

        eight survived the first year, living in a 36 x 18 foot common sod
        house, until O’Neill’s second colony arrived in May 1875. This
        second group of about two dozen men, women, and children met eight very
        unhappy people, all of who blamed John O’Neill for their misfortunes.
        O’Neill was accused of deceit. He had, after all, promised the
        settlers they would be able to harvest 250-300 bushels per acre. Though
        those words were O’Neill’s, it was Patrick Fahy who had duped the
        General himself. Fahy had not fulfilled any of his promised assistance,

        After the General showed the previous correspondence with Fahy, which
        promised buildings and improvements, none of which the Omaha speculator
        provided, many, though not all, of the settlers regained trust in
        O’Neill.</font></b></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height:150%"><b><font size="3">O’Neill’s
        efforts were hindered by his own financial dealings with his boss.
        Fahy’s agreement was for O’Neill to bring in twenty-five families,
        and he was only able to get half, so Fahy withheld some of O’Neill’s
        agreed upon fee. O’Neill often had to cajole Fahy for his salary, and
        in one letter from the East he stated, “you treated me shamefully and
        would not even answer my letters or telegrams, but simply trifled with
        me.”<a style="mso-endnote-id:edn151" href="#_edn151" name="_ednref151" title><span class="MsoEndnoteReference">21</span></a>In

        long-term goal was to raise midwestern soldiers that would fight
        England, he was nonetheless committed to the Nebraska project, and
        O’Neill’s word was usually his bond.<a style="mso-endnote-id:edn152" href="#_edn152" name="_ednref152" title><span class="MsoEndnoteReference">22</span></a></font></b></p>

        arrival of his second colony, O’Neill seems to have had an epiphany of

        settled in O’Neill, and colonization<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
        </span>became for the first time the most dominant theme in his life. He
        finally understood, in the words of singer Christy Moore, “some high
        ground is not worth taking, and some connections are not worth
        making.”<a style="mso-endnote-id:edn153" href="#_edn153" name="_ednref153" title><span class="MsoEndnoteReference">23</span></a>
        Mary Ann had arrived in the spring of 1874 with the original colonists,
        but was pregnant and stayed in Omaha, 180 miles away. After Katherine
        (Kate) O’Neill was born on July 31, the General proved his own
        commitment to the Nebraska plan by arriving with his wife, John Hugh, 8,
        Mary Ella, 6, and the baby, Kate, nine months. In addition, he had
        convinced his brother Bernard’s two oldest sons to make the leap of
        faith and move from Elizabeth. John J. O’Neill, now 21, and Tom
        O’Neill, 18, were the General’s two oldest nephews. John J would
        play an important role, surveying and platting each colonists claim, the
        beginning of a fine career as an engineer, mostly in New Jersey.<a style="mso-endnote-id:edn154" href="#_edn154" name="_ednref154" title><span class="MsoEndnoteReference">24</span></a>
        Indeed, the General seemed to finally understand his old military
        mission was over. “I have tried to do the best I could to give the
        Irish people their freedom at home, and for the time being at least, I
        have failed. I have now engaged in doing what I believe to be the next
        best thing.”<a style="mso-endnote-id:

        months after arriving, these second colonists were living in sod or log
        houses, the nearest timber cut eighteen miles away, then hauled back to
        the new colony, now called O’Neill. The first frame building was
        erected in October 1875, and it became a store run by Patrick Hagerty.
        It would not be until the third colonists arrived in 1876 with the
        General from Chicago that much progress besides survival could be
        noticed. With the nation’s economy improving, O’Neill found one
        hundred and two more citizens to add to the population, and soon there
        would be a post office and a primitive school. In 1877 a fourth and
        final group of just under a hundred arrived with the General.<a style="mso-endnote-id:edn156" href="#_edn156" name="_ednref156" title><span class="MsoEndnoteReference">26</span></a></font></b></p>

        Some of the settlers were still not content, and complained that the
        overzealous General had betrayed them, and accused O’Neill of gross
        opportunism. They had a point. In a pamphlet O’Neill had published
        promoting the Holt County scheme, O’Neill stated, “If a man comes
        west in the spring he builds himself a small house of sods or cottonwood
        timber. He then plows a few acres, plants corn or potatoes in the sod.
        His cow is staked in a rich bottom, his patch of green vegetables grows
        in the front of his door, and four months after he arrived at his new
        home he is home indeed.”<a style="mso-endnote-id:edn158" href="#_edn158" name="_ednref158" title><span class="MsoEndnoteReference">28</span></a>
        Out of necessity the settlers looked at the short term, survival, while
        O’Neill, to be gracious, had long-term vision in mind.</font></b></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height:150%"><b><font size="3">Nonetheless,
        O’Neill attached himself to the concept of the Irish in Nebraska with
        the same unbridled energy he had bestowed upon Fenianism. Chauncey
        Wiltse, a government surveyor, was unusually impressed. “General
        O’Neill is a stranger to me, I had met him but once previously to his
        present visit to Omaha, at O’Neill City. I found him at work making
        himself thoroughly acquainted with that entire section of the country.
        He has traveled over it in person, slept on the ground with no cover but
        for the wagon box, eating such food as campers-out are compelled to eat,
        often going hungry, enduring anything, no matter how great the hardship,
        so that he might become perfectly familiar with the country, and able to
        represent it from personal observation. I admire his course, and approve
        his undertaking. My sympathies and hopes are strongly in favor of
        General O’Neill.”<a style="mso-endnote-id:edn159" href="#_edn159" name="_ednref159" title><span class="MsoEndnoteReference">29</span></a></font></b></p>

        Philadelphia, the official headquarters of <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">O’Neill’s
        ‘Irish American Colonies,</i>’ and traveled ceaselessly. While Mary
        Ann and the young O’Neill’s were barely surviving in a sod house on
        the prairie, Catherine O’Neill, 75, died on Price Street, “after a

        as he had been speaking in eastern Pennsylvania for several weeks, but
        the local newspaper obituary mentioned only Bernard as a surviving son.
        Catherine was surrounded by the rest of the Macklin and O’Neill
        families, and buried at the small Saint Mary Cemetery.<a style="mso-endnote-id:edn161" href="#_edn161" name="_ednref161" title><span class="MsoEndnoteReference">31</span></a>
        She had raised a famous son, a loving daughter Mary, and Bernard, a
        popular and successful merchant. The news did not reach Catherine’s
        daughter in law, or the five grandchildren in the town named after her
        youngest son, for weeks, and there would be no mass celebrated in
        Nebraska, as the first church in O’Neill would not be built for two
        more years.</font></b></p>

        the colony of O’Neill was growing into a town, and Irish settlers sent
        by the General were populating new sites at Atkinson, Spalding, and
        Greeley, eventually cementing John Charles O’Neill’s future
        reputation in Nebraska history. O’Neill received a fine accolade from
        the <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Irish Catholic Benevolent
        Union Journal.</i> “When others talked of the good to be done by
        colonization, General O’Neill selected a portion of Nebraska for the
        settlement of such as were willing to follow him. To be sure, he has
        been maligned and his efforts condemned, but no man, lay or
        ecclesiastic, can engage in this work without being censured. General
        O’Neill has stood the assaults on his motives, character and efforts
        as unflinchingly as he has bourne still more dangerous, though with more

        He appealed to the Catholic Church for compensation, reminding them of
        his colonization accomplishments, but was denied, and the Nebraska

        British account of the Fenian Brotherhood that could almost pass for

        Irish-American community nationwide, charging that the 1868
        assassination of Thomas D’Arcy McGee in Montreal was ordered and
        orchestrated by O’Neill, then president of the Fenian Brotherhood. The
        accusation was a complete lie, but it stung O’Neill, whose battle

        an Irish weapon, insisting on “fair and honorable fight forever.”<a style="mso-endnote-id:edn165" href="#_edn165" name="_ednref165" title><span class="MsoEndnoteReference">34</span></a>

        had been the male leader of the family since 1840 when he and his sister
        Catherine O’Neill had immigrated to New Jersey. For almost forty years
        John Macklin had been a successful businessman and father, and his
        funeral was attended by every major figure in Elizabeth. John and his
        wife Jane (Murphy) had twelve children, ten of whom reached adulthood.
        Only the youngest, Charles, had sons, as six of the other ten remained
        unmarried or had no children. The Macklin name died out in America by
        1950.<a style="mso-endnote-id:edn178" href="#_edn178" name="_ednref178" title><span class="MsoEndnoteReference">1</span></a></b></p>

        J. Macklin, the eldest son, was the only Macklin cousin close to John
        O’Neill. George was the best man at O’Neill’s wedding in 1864; the
        godfather of his only son in 1866; and fought with him at Ridgeway. But
        George left Nashville and soldier life after the Canadian affair and
        returned to Elizabeth, where he worked with his father as a clerk in the
        uptown grocery business until 1876. At age 32 he left New Jersey again,
        but this time for good. In 1900 the 56 year old George was still single
        and living alone in the Bowery in Manhattan, not a good place.<a style="mso-endnote-id:edn179" href="#_edn179" name="_ednref179" title><span class="MsoEndnoteReference">2</span></a>

        buried in the family plot at St. Mary’s Cemetery, while the others
        after 1900 are scattered throughout New York. Except for George, none of

        was the closest of all the O’Neill’s to the General, and as an older
        man gave further evidence of the split between brothers John and
        Bernard, with John J. seemingly siding with the General.</b></p>

        Orange, New Jersey, an affluent suburb ten miles north of Elizabeth. In
        late 1892, still a young man, he purchased a family plot at Holy
        Sepulchre Cemetery in East Orange, where his wife Imogene and only son
        William would one day be buried. But John’s first act after the
        purchase was to remove his grandmother Catherine O’Neill, his aunt
        Mary O’Neill, and John’s sister Mary from the O’Neill family plot
        at St. Mary’s and have them interred in East Orange. He left his

        though he did not go home to New Jersey. This was not uncommon with
        early settlers, as James Cutler wrote in <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">The
        History of Holt County</i>, in 1882. “Most men prefer to endure the
        privations of a new country than subject themselves to the ridicule of

        return to the conveniences, comforts, and delights of home.”<a style="mso-endnote-id:edn183" href="#_edn183" name="_ednref183" title><span class="MsoEndnoteReference">6</span></a>

        of Our Lady of Angels in downtown San Diego. In truth, these

        would be fighting to protect England. If the young O’Neill were truly

        American continent. John O’Neill was a paradox, it is true. He invaded
        Canada, only to be a major reason it became a free land. He preached
        Nebraska colonization, but spent little time there, and came close to,
        at times, abandonment of his wife and children. He drank too much, but
        preached temperance to the colonizers. All agreed the General was ego
        driven, but none doubted his sincerity. He was a devout Catholic, though

            O’Neill’s mother’s name was never mentioned in any of the many
            articles or biographical material until 2000, when a supposed Irish
            relative came to O’Neill, Nebraska as the Grand Marshall of the
            local Saint Patrick Day Parade. Gerard O’Neill, an Irish
            politician, wrote that O’Neill’s mother was Elizabeth, and
            “her name is still remembered as in Beth’s Lane, just below
            where the O’Neill home was.” This is simply fiction. There is no
            proof as well that John O’Neill stayed with his paternal relatives
            at all. Rather, all signs point to Catherine and her children living
            with the Macklin’s, George and Mary. No O’Neill relative has
            unfortunately ever been identified, either in Ireland or America,
            either by the General in his many interviews, or other Macklin or
            O’Neill relatives. In the 1911 Ireland census, there were still
            three male Macklin’s in Clontibert Parish (Edward, George and
            Henry). There were no O’Neill’s left in the parish, though that
            of course does not preclude O’Neill’s nearby.</font></b></p>

            <p class="MsoEndnoteText" style="line-height: 100%"><b><font size="2">Langan,
            who had some family input, said she “was a student in a boarding
            school run by the Sisters of Charity,” a nice way perhaps of
            saying an orphanage. Le Caron said Mary Ann was in fact a nun, but
            this is incorrect. Sister Margaret Ann Gainey, archivist of the
            Sisters of Charity in California, told the author in an interview
            that at no time did a Mary Ann Crow profess any vows in the order,
            and believes Langan is correct. Indeed, Sister Margaret says it is
            very possible the order may have helped “match” the Australian
            orphan and O’Neill, the nuns making sure their orphan students
            ended up with a good prospective Catholic boy, which O’Neill
            surely was. Sister Margaret even went so far as to say the sisters
            even traveled east with the girls to their convent in Emmitsburg,
            Maryland to match them up.</font></b></p>

            O’Neill was a major stump speaker not only at Fenian conventions,
            but in numerous Fenian outdoor “picnics” (fund raisers) – and
            in Chicago (on August 15, 1866 as one example) and New York spoke to
            great applause in front of more than a reported 100,000 people.
            Within one year of Ridgeway, John O’Neill would rely on his
            “cunning peasant” socialability for the rest of his life.</font></b></p>

        Fox family genealogy. The most ironical discovery of this research was
        finding Catherine O’Neill, and the O’Neill children, living right
        next door to Laurence and Catherine Fox, my great-great grandparents, on
        Price Street in Elizabeth. Proof of the General’s popularity is the
        very rare census notation next to Catherine O’Neill’s name, which is
        followed at the bottom of the page with “General O’Neill’s
        mother”.</b></font></p>
