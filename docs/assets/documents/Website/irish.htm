	<p align="left"><strong><big>These three families all came from
    Ireland during the Famine years. </big></strong></p>
    <p align="left"><strong><big>The Ruddy's: James, Michael, Thomas and (probably) 
	Nicholas came from, maybe,&nbsp;Oughaval Roman Catholic parish in Co. Mayo during the 1840's.
    Recent research unearthed a document saying that Michael and Catherine were
    born in Clifton, Ireland [perhaps this meant Clifden, County Galway about 35 miles
    southwest of Westport where Michael and Catherine were married]. To this
    point I am sceptical that the family originated in Clifden, County Galway based on previous
    research. Another enclave of Ruddy's existed about 30 miles North and a bit
    West in Kilfian Parish ** where an instance of the rare name Nicholas Ruddy
    is also found Although the pronunciation of Clifton and Kilfian are far
    apart, one should not discount family lore*. Michael and Catherine went on to Liverpool and then on to New York City then
    to Syracuse, NY and, finally, they migrated to Iowa to join James Ruddy in
    Fairview Township. James Ruddy showed up in Iowa at the
    death of Thomas and married Ellen Murphy in Prairie de Chein. James Ruddy and his family moved by covered
      wagon in 1871-1872 to Wellington township in Renville County, Minnesota 
	near the town of Fairfax.</big></strong></p>
	<p align="left"><strong><big>The Murphy's emigrated from Co Limerick about 1850,
    stopped in Boston and then
    also migrated to Iowa.&nbsp;</big></strong></p>
	<p align="left"><strong><big>The Garrahy's were some of the first
    arrivals in Wellington Township migrating there in 1868 from Co Clare, Ireland by way
    of England and Massachusetts. </big></strong></p>
	<p align="left"><strong><big>These families intermarried in Iowa and Minnesota.</big></strong></p>
	<p align="left"><strong><big>The genealogy can be seen by clicking the links below:<br>
&nbsp;</big></strong></p><p align="left"><font size="2"><strong><big>*The
    document was the death certificate of Daniel Ruddy [born in Syracuse in
    1856, died in Chicago 1n 1935]&nbsp; son of Michael &amp; Catherine, the
    document indicates the informant for this information was Daniel's son in
    law Joseph Klinger and I remain sceptical with other research showing
    Westport for the marriage of Michael &amp; Catherine and a document that
    shows Catherine's brother Thomas Gibbons was born in Westport supports this
    scepticism. Without any further information Westport is pretty certain to be
    the area they lived before emigrating to Liverpool and Kilmeena is a
    possible area from which the Ruddy family originated based on other research
    explained elsewhere. [note: Oct 22, 2011]</big></strong></font></p><p align="center"><font size="3"><strong><big><font size="4"><big>**A
