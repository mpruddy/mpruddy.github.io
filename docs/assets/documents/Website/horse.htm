REMARKS<br>
<br>
One of this claimants witnesses says &quot;I was off in the army
three years one month &amp; 19 days.&quot; + + &quot;I went into
the army the 2nd day of April the second year of the war.&quot;
It appears from this that he served until the 21st day of May
1865. He also says &quot;I was a Union man at the commencement of
the war and all of the time.&quot; He entered the army before the
first conscript law was passed so must have volunteered. It will
be perceived that the opinion of such a witness entertaining such
a notion of constitutes a Union man is utterly worthless &amp;
when he says of the claimant &quot;I know the he was a strong
Union man&quot; the statement is entitled to no weight whatever.
It is very evident that this claimant was just exactly such a
Union man as this witness for he was also in the Confederate army
from the fall of 186__ until the 2nd day of May 1865. He also
took the oath to support the Confederacy. Mr. Middleton may have
been a Union man according to the standard of Monroe Co., Ala.
but he served too long as a solder in the Confederate army for a
&#145;loyal adherent to the cause &amp; the government of the
United States.&quot;<br>
<br>
The claim is disallowed.<br>
