				<p>Colonel Minty was arrested and sent to Murfreesboro at for 
				remaining in camp above Shelbyville while at Farmington a major 
				encounter took place between General Crook's troops of which 
				Minty was a part and Wheeler's cavalry. Minty was cleared in the 
				Court Martial of disobedience of orders, since General Crook 
				under oath admitted he did not give the orders to Minty to move 
				up to the front. Still in hindsight perhaps there is a hint of 
				uneasiness in Potter's diary when he says in his diary on 
				October 6 and 7:</p>
				<p>[October 6] &quot;Could hear cannonading at night. [October 7] 
				&quot;Laid in camp until one o’clock pm when our Brigade moved on – 
				every thing in advance of us – passed thro’ Shelbyville – some 
				of the western army was there – glad to see them with us. Saw 
				some colored soldiers – came to Farmington 16 miles from 
				Shelbyville – reached camp about 9 o’clock pm – hard fight today 
				– with the rebels – Wilder’s infantry had the most to do – or 
				did the most at least – whipped Wheeler Splendidly – captured 
				240 prisoners – 4 pieces of artillery &amp; killed 60 – our loss 15 
				killed.&quot;</p>
				<p>And later on Potter writes, perhaps after having heard Minty 
				complaining about Crook's slowness to attack at Cotton Port, 
				when on October 9th Potter adopts Minty's attitude:</p>
				<p>&quot;Thus endeth Wheeler’s <u>great</u> <u>cavalry</u> <u>Raid</u> 
				– he has passed entirely round our [right? rear?] his loss must 
				be 600 men all told &amp; four pieces of artillery – he has captured 
				some of our stores at McMinnville – burnt 300 wagons at Dunlap – 
				getting about 2000 mules from us &amp; burnt a couple of bridges – 
				he never should have been allowed to cross the Tennessee – 
				somebody is to blame.&quot; </p>
