      ultimate achievement was to organize a body of armed Irishmen ready to
      attack the British Empire on two continents. O’Mahony christened his
      organization “The Fenian Brotherhood” basing the name on the Gaelic
      word <i>Fianna</i>, a sort of Praetorian Guard to the high king in 3<sup>rd</sup>

  cigarette smoke laid heavy. Below the layer of smoke, John O’Mahony and

  importance. His every pore breathed unbounded optimism and a firm commitment
  to Ireland’s fight for freedom. A born conspirator with ceaseless energy and
  a capability to organize, this was the man who could ready Ireland for the
  coming struggle. Stephens opened the message, glanced for a moment at the
  signatures on the bottom, and began scheming. His response to New York used as
  a courier O’Mahony’s confidant, Joseph Denieffe, who had been sent to
  Ireland to assess the possibility of stirring the people to another rebellion.<a style="mso-footnote-id:
ftn21" href="#_ftn21" name="_ftnref21" title><span style="mso-special-character: footnote" class="MsoFootnoteReference">[21]</span></a>
  Stephens consented to join the group, but only if he was chosen supreme leader
  with dictatorial powers: “A few words as to my position. I believe it
  essential to success that the centre of this or any similar organization
  should be unshackled; in other words, a provisional dictator. On this point I
  can conscientiously concede nothing.”<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn22" href="#_ftn22" name="_ftnref22" title><span style="mso-special-character: footnote" class="MsoFootnoteReference">[22]</span></a></font></b></p>

  independence was more important and he accepted Stephens’ leadership of the
  overall organization. Stephens sailed in October of 1858 to America and
  ceremoniously appointed O’Mahony “Head Centre” of the American branch.
  Irish Nationalism was now solidified in America and Ireland by this most
  unlikely alliance. A learned, idealistic, almost graceful John O’Mahony and
  a blustering, pompous, carnival huckster James Stephens put aside their
  differences and began the process of recruiting and training men.</font></b></p>

ingredient into the mix. By 1860 the bitter gap between North and South had
widened and the fibers holding the United States together began to unravel.
Stirred to combat by political leaders too proud or too stubborn to yield,
volunteers poured into the enlistment centers. Before it was over three and one
half million men fought and five hundred thousand died.<a style="mso-footnote-id:

What motivated Irishmen to risk their lives in ‘America’s fight’? Many
spoke only Gaelic or broken English and lived on the fringes of society, pushed
there by their lack of education, their Catholicism, and the normal reaction of
an established culture towards those who were different. The North-South
polarization which had festered through a century of economic and political
warfare between plantation farming and mercantile opportunism might explain why
an exasperated tradesman in New York or farmer in South Carolina would grab a
musket and march off to solve the problem. It did not explain the Irish soldier.</font></b></p>

With names like “The Phoenix Brigade” and “The Emmet Guards” these
groups met, paraded, and drilled for the next great rising in Ireland.
Understandably a synergy formed between Irish patriots drilling and training and
the sudden need for Yankee and Rebel soldiers. Caught up in dreams of glory and
a chance to test themselves in combat, recruited and led by men eager for
military promotion, some of these Irish military units enlisted to a man into
the nearest volunteer regiment.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn31" href="#_ftn31" name="_ftnref31" title><span style="mso-special-character: footnote; font-size: 10.0pt" class="MsoFootnoteReference">[31]</span></a>

</span>Irishmen flung themselves into battle on both sides of the Mason-Dixon
Line flying symbolic green flags of a non-existent nation. They fought, many
times against one other, for Ireland’s freedom. Envisioning Irishmen fighting
Irishmen in America’s Civil War, John O’Mahony tried to dissuade Fenian
military units from joining the rush to enlist. “The first enemies the 69<sup>th</sup>

It fell on deaf ears. Finding himself powerless to stop the rising Irish
enlistment, he made an adroit about-face and discovered the silver lining.
Forthcoming battles would serve as a training ground upon which Irish generals,
captains, sergeants, corporals, and privates could learn the art of war in
preparation for the fight for Irish freedom. O’Mahony took advantage of his
change in policy and organized the New York 99<sup>th</sup> National Guards

front along the narrow, tenement-lined streets of the city. Thousands of men,
women, and children turned out to send their boys into battle. Fluttering over
the recruits was a new splendid green flag overflowing with symbols of Irish
Nationalism: an uncrowned harp; a golden sunburst; a wreath of shamrocks; and,
in Gaelic, the old battle cry “Never Retreat from A Clash of Spears.”<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn34" href="#_ftn34" name="_ftnref34" title><span style="mso-special-character: footnote; font-size: 10.0pt" class="MsoFootnoteReference">[34]</span></a>

going to war. It was a heady brew.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn35" href="#_ftn35" name="_ftnref35" title><span style="mso-special-character: footnote; font-size: 10.0pt" class="MsoFootnoteReference">[35]</span></a>
Along that parade route, if you were Irish, a vision began to take shape of a
battlefield in a future Ireland, a cowering enemy wearing the hated Saxon
crimson awaiting the charge of Erin’s green host. One final victorious attack
and Ireland would be free forever. If you were one of the paid informers posted
along the route that afternoon, the notes you jotted down were scarcely
comforting to your paymasters up in Canada or back in Britain. Carrying Irish
dreams, the men of the 69th marched off to the piers and boarded a ship for
Virginia. At Bull Run, Fredricksburg, Chancellorsville, and in many other
battles the 69<sup>th</sup> joined the regiments that made up the Irish Brigade
and fought bravely against a gray Confederate Army. For many Irishmen this was
not the most important fight.</font></b></p>

together by one of his military advisors, Bernard Dorian Killian, intended to
land an armed Fenian force on Campobello, a small Canadian island near Eastport,
Maine. The perceptive <u>Illustrated London News</u> reported, “It seems the

O’Neill cut off and forced to retreat with his troops back onto United States
territory was captured along with the remaining Fenians. While O’Neill was
engaged at Ridgeway, Fenian Brigadier General Samuel Spears commanding 1200
soldiers marched into Canada at Pigeon Hill across the Vermont-Quebec border.
Spears made a speech and, upon hearing British Regulars were headed his way,
re-crossed the border into the waiting arms of the U.S. Army. With most Fenians
now in custody, the United States government, one eye fixed on England and the
other on the Irish vote, decided to discretely release the majority on nominal
bond dispersing them with railroad tickets home. There is a temptation to join

and it does not take too much imagination to see the kind of havoc that could
have been wrought had the Fenians planned events a little better. An established
base on Canadian soil would have provided the possibility of recognition of the
Fenians as a belligerent government in control of its territory. This very
recognition Queen Victoria’s British government gave the Confederate States at
the commencement of the Civil War and it still rankled in Washington. The
British Minister, Sir Fredrick Bruce, saw the possibilities, too, noting that
Major Thomas Sweeny, still on active service in the United States Army, was
laying out strategy for an Irish attack on Canada. Bruce voiced his concern to
Seward. “It seems to me he ought to choose between the North American and the
Irish Republic.”<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn74" href="#_ftn74" name="_ftnref74" title><span style="mso-special-character: footnote; font-size: 10.0pt" class="MsoFootnoteReference">[74]</span></a>
The possibilities of 1866 were illuminated further two years later. Fenian
Brigadier General John O’Neill was called into a meeting at the White House
with President Andrew Johnson. “General, your people unfairly blame me a good
deal for the part I took in stopping your first movement. Now I want you to
understand that my sympathies are entirely with you, and anything which lies in
my power I am willing to do to assist you. But you must remember that I gave you
5 full days before issuing any proclamation stopping you. What, in God’s name,
more did you want? If you could not get there in 5 days, by God, you could never
get there; and then, as President, I was compelled to enforce our Neutrality
Laws, or be denounced on every side.”<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn75" href="#_ftn75" name="_ftnref75" title><span style="mso-special-character: footnote; font-size: 10.0pt" class="MsoFootnoteReference">[75]</span></a>
We are left to judge whether wily William Seward and pragmatic President Johnson
had given the Fenians all the time they could afford to give; or, perhaps more
likely, stepped in before war with Great Britain became a real possibility.</font></b></p>

aristocratic birthright and devoted his life to the cause of Irish freedom and
it had killed him. Surrounding himself with sycophants and informers, he did not

and Canadian intelligence insuring Canadian troops were in place before the
attacks began. The first assault was made across the Vermont-Quebec border near
Eccles Hill on May 25, 1870. Now a Fenian Brigadier General, John O’Neill sent
Fenian Captain Cronan and 400 Vermont Fenian soldiers across the border into

Brotherhood and its posture as an Irish government in exile appear almost
farcical as we look back from a modern vantage point; at the time, however,
newspapers reported wild stories of Fenian strength and the populace took these
exaggerations as true. In England Prime Minister William Ewart Gladstone viewed
Fenianism as the direct result of Parliament’s procrastination in facing Irish
problems. “[British rule in Ireland] is in my opinion, so long as it
continues, an intolerable disgrace, and a danger so absolutely transcending all
others, that I call it the only real danger of the noble empire of the Queen.”<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn84" href="#_ftn84" name="_ftnref84" title><span style="mso-special-character: footnote; font-size: 10.0pt" class="MsoFootnoteReference">[84]</span></a>

hatred of the British with the military environment that existed in America
before and during the Civil War to forge an Irish Nationalist movement in exile,
much of it under arms. The Fenians using the threat of a negative Irish vote
successfully created interlocks between American politics, Irish aspirations,
and United States’ relations with Great Britain. The result found the British
government weighing each action it took in Ireland against the possible effect
it might have on the Irish vote in the United States and any resultant shift in
United States policy toward Britain. It was, to say the least, an uncomfortable
position for the policy-makers of the British Empire.</font></b></p>
<p class="MsoBodyText2" style="line-height:200%"><b><font size="3">The effect of tying Irish votes
to foreign relations served to magnify the power of the Fenian Brotherhood. The
actual strength or capability of the movement was never quite clear in Britain
or the United States as these two worthy governments threatened each other with
Fenian consequences. Playing on the worst fears of both, the Fenians came very
close to inciting a war between the United States and Great Britain that could

    “Fenian Brotherhood” and “The Irish Republican Brotherhood” were
    used interchangeably amongst both groups and the word “Fenian” is still
    used today to refer to Irish nationalists. The Fenians and the IRB were the
    forerunners of present day Ireland's nationalist alliances: in America the
    Clan Na Gael and in Ireland Sinn Fein, a political group, and the affiliated
    Irish Republican Army (IRA) paramilitary group.<span style="color:red"> <o:p>

    I have seen many different reasons given to explain the “of the Sword”
    sobriquet that always follows Thomas Meagher’s name. Perhaps it is
    worthwhile to dispel the uncertainty. In the early 1800s there was a
    movement led by Daniel O’Connell to repeal the law that stripped Ireland
    of her Parliament. O’Connell demanded nonviolent, political methods to
    this end. When Meagher and others began to advocate military action should
    political action fail, they were asked to renounce all violence or be thrown
    out of the movement. Meagher, an eloquent orator, arose and spoke. He did
    not advocate violence, he said, but in the absence of success, he would
    never “abhor the sword.” Ever after he was called Meagher “of the
    Sword.”</p>

    Thomas Francis Meagher</u>, op. cit., p.362 and <u>The Fenian Movement in
    the United States 1858-1886</u>, op. cit., p32. But Cavanagh does not sound
    convincing and D’Arcy is citing a letter by O’Mahony published in 1886,
    9 years after Meagher’s death in Montana in1867. Cf. John Savage in <u>Fenian
    Heroes and Martyrs</u>, op. cit. p.63, “Meagher if he did not actively
    enter into the movement afterwards….” Savage is speaking of Meagher
    helping to get money to send Stephens at the time Doheny and O’Mahony were
    starting the movement. Savage later was elected to O’Mahony’s spot as
    president of the O’Mahony Wing and had as much reason in 1868 to claim
    Meagher as a Fenian as Cavenagh or O’Mahony did, yet, Savage does not list
    him in his book as a Fenian. That is more than sufficient cause to doubt
    Cavanagh and O’Mahony; however, as pointed out to me by Marta Roman, a
    Fenian researcher, Meagher’s letter to the Fenian
    Convention of 1863 on page 20 of the published “Proceedings” wherein
    Meagher gives his approval of contemplated changes it is hard not to
    conclude he was an official member who maintained a public distance from the
    Fenians for political reasons.</p>

    <u><span style="color:red">Fenians and Anglo-American Relations During

    p.150, published in Ithaca, New York 1969. He is quoting a June 16, 1866
    letter from H.W. Hemans, British consul at Buffalo to Sir Fredrick Bruce,
    British minister to the United States. The quantity of muskets issued from
    or stored in Philadelphia was 6,500 and in New York, 2000 as stated by
    Fenian Major of Ordnance, W. M. O’Reilly in a letter to Fenian Major
    General Thomas W. Sweeny on May 3, 1866 found in the appendix of <u>A
    Personal Narrative of the Irish Revolutionary Brotherhood</u>, op. cit.,
    p.233.</p>

    relieve Sweeny from his U.S. Army command for being AWOL two weeks later, by
    then Sweeny had been Fenian Secretary of War for three months. Washington
    constantly brought up the Alabama reparations claims when Britain discussed
    Fenian doings with the implication that they might allow the Fenian
    incursions to occur and perhaps do nothing unless the claims were paid. Of
    course, the Fenians came to the same conclusion.</p>
