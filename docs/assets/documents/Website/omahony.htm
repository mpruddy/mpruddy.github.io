		<font size="4">The muster-roll of those who were prominently identified with the 
Irish National movement of 1848 is fast being reduced by death. Within the past 
eighteen months Mitchel, Martin and Ronayne have passed away. And now the grave 
has claimed another tenant, who in his day filled no small space in the public 
mind and in the history of his time. Colonel John O'Mahony, ex-head Centre of 
the Fenian Brotherhood, died on the 6th inst. at his residence, Sixth Avenue, in 
this city, after a lingering illness, of dropsy super-induced by disease of the 
kidneys. His last appearance in public was on the occasion of the meeting at the 
Cooper Institute, on the anniversary of the execution of the Manchester Martyrs. 
At that meeting — at which he presided — he contracted a cold which at once 
prostrated him, and was the proximate cause of his death, as he never rallied 
from the effects of it. During his illness he was attended by Drs. John Dwyer 
and Denis Dowling Mulcahy, and was visited by a few old and attached friends, 
who saw that he wanted for nothing that his condition required. For the root it 
is hot justice to his memory to state that be died a poor man — the most 
emphatic refutation of the idea — if any such were ever entertained — that he 
profited in any way by his lifelong devotion and service in the cause of his 
native land.</font></b></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: .5in"><b>
		<font size="4">Colonel John O'Mahony was born in 1816 in the neighborhood of 
Mitchelstown county Cork. The earlier portion of his life was spent in the same 
locality — a small estate which, had long been in the possession of his 
ancestors and where his family — an ancient and respectable one — had resided 
for many generations exercising a sort of chieftainship over the surrounding 
peasantry. This property was originally worth about £1,000 a year, but the 
extravagance of some members of the family had reduced it down to a value of 
£300. This relic of his paternal property O’Mahony inherited, his elder brother, 
Thomas, having died early; but when he became an outlaw, to save it from 
forfeiture, he was obliged to convey it to his sister, Mrs. Mandeville, who now 
holds it.</font></b></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: .5in"><b>
		<font size="4">The members of the O’Mahony family had always been remarkable 
during the period of the Penal Laws for strenuously taking the side of the 
people against the Earls of Kingston, who were then noted for their oppressive 
conduct. His father and uncles were also implicated in the insurrection of ’98, 
and escaped execution I only by the sudden death of their chief enemy, Lord 
Kingston, who was moving heaven and earth for their destruction.</font></b></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: .5in"><b>
		<font size="4">John O'Mahony and his brother both received their preliminary 
education at Hamlin's school, in Midleton, county Cord, and after time proceeded 
together to Dublin, where John attended lectures at Trinity College for several 
years, though he finally left without obtaining a degree. His early manhood was 
spent at the place of his nativity, where the family's feud with the Kingstons 
and their hereditary championship of the peasantry seem to have early infected 
him with a strong tinge of national sentiment. He attended many of the great 
Repeal meetings which O'Connell held in Cork and Tipperary in the course of the 
years 1843 and 1844, and soon became&nbsp; imbued with a strong admiration for the 
Great Agitator, who also happened to be a friend of his father.</font></b></p>

		<font size="4">On the secession of the &quot;Young Ireland &quot; party from Conciliation 
Hall. O'Mahony himself with the revolutionary element of the national party; and 
when William Smith O'Brien and the chiefs of Young Ireland &quot;took to the hills,&quot; 
after John Mitchel's arrest and transportation, O'Mahony was one of the first to 
join them at the head of a considerable body of the peasantry of Tipperary and 
Cork. O'Brien's failure at Ballingarry ended the short campaign, as far as the 
main body of the revolutionists was concerned; but even after the capture of his 
leader, O'Mahony, favored by his knowledge of the country, managed to keep the 
field with a small number of followers for several weeks, and at last effected 
his escape to Wales, from whence he was able to secure passage to France, where 
he joined the little knot of rebel leaders who had succeeded in reaching the 
Continent despite the efforts of the English Government for their capture.</font></b></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: .5in"><b>
		<font size="4">In 1854 John Mitchel effected his escape from exile, in Van 
Dieman's land, and made his way to New York. O’Mahony immediately left Paris and 
hastened to join him. The Irish national movement here had then taken shape as a 
semi-military organization, under the name of &quot;The Emmet Monument Association,&quot; 
of which Mitchel was chosen the leader, with plenary powers; and hopes were 
entertained, at the breaking out of the war with Russia, that a good blow would 
be stuck for Ireland's deliverance But the hoped for &quot;opportunity&quot; came and 
passed unavailed of. Mitchell left New York to reside in Tennessee; and soon 
after the &quot;Emmet Monument Association spit into two factions at the Astor House 
Convention, one party retaining the old name and organization under the lead of 
Michael Doheny and John O&quot;Mahony, the other — of Robert Tyler (Son of 
ex-President Tyler) was the nominal head, — the name of &quot;Emigrant Aid 
Association,&quot; and including the nationalists of Pennsylvania and the Eastern and 
Western states. Both continued to regard Mitchel as their chosen leader; but the 
division was fatal to the organization; and it languished until the breaking out 
of the so-called &quot;Phoenix&quot; movement in Ireland, in 1858, imparted new vigor to 
the national aspirations of the members.</font></b></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: .5in"><b>
		<font size="4">Previous to this, however, O'Mahony had undertaken the 
translation of Dr. Keating's &quot;History of Ireland&quot; from the Gaelic, and to this 
work he devoted about two years of constant labor and study. While engaged on 
this work his health broke down; his mind gave way completely; and for some time 
he had to be placed under restraint in a lunatic asylum. Here after a short 
period of medical treatment he was restored to health and sanity and returned to 
the busy world, pronounced entirely cured. Subsequent events, however, render it 
doubtful whether his mind ever regained its original healthy tone; and many of 
the aberrations of which ever his warmest friends had to complain during his 
later career, are most easily and charitably construed as being due to the 
effect of an intellect subject to periods of partial disorder. His book, which 
had been delayed by his illness was published in 1857 but the protraction of its 
publication, and the heavy expenses attendant on its issue rendered it of no 
pecuniary benefit to him; nor did he derive any from a second and revised 
edition which be get out in 1866. The stereotype plates were paid for and 
presented to him by a few of his friends and admirers in the United States. 
Where they are at present we know not.</font></b></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: .5in"><b>
		<font size="4">The origin of the &quot;Fenian Brotherhood&quot; in American may be dated 
from the explosion of the &quot;Phoenix&quot; conspiracy in Ireland, in the later end of 
1858. Up to that time the &quot;Emmet Monument Association&quot; had been a recognized 
organization; and as Mitchel had neither resigned nor been removed from its 
leadership, he was still regarded as its actual Chief. A new organization was 
started at a meeting held in old Tammany Hall. O'Mahony was elected its chief 
officer, and as the &quot;Emmet Monument Association,&quot; for want of proper direction, 
had ceased all practical work, the new body quickly absorbed all the active 
elements of the older one. O'Mahony had been commissioned by James Stephens, — 
then in Ireland, — and for some time continued to act in subordination to the 
Irish revolutionary executive. But this condition of things was not only 
repugnant to his own feelings, but proved an insuperable barrier to the progress 
of the movement at this side of the ocean. The breaking out of the American 
civil war, in 1861, drew off the great bulk of the young Irish-American military 
element into the ranks on either side, and, in 1864, it became necessary to 
reorganize the Fenian Brotherhood, in order to place it on an effective footing. 
This was begun at the Chicago Convention, in which the representatives of the 
Brotherhood declared it distinct from and independent of all other bodies while 
ready cooperate with all having the freedom of Ireland in view. The Chicago 
Fair, at which a large sum of money was raised, followed, and the organization 
of the Fenian Brotherhood was completed at the Cincinnati Convention, in January 
1865, where the organization was rendered a strictly representative body, 
governed by an elected Centre and council, and having in no sense the 
characteristics of a secret society. Its territory was also limited to the 
United States and the British possessions in North America.</font></b></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: .5in"><b>
		<font size="4">At this time, O’Mahony held the rank of Colonel of the 99<sup>th</sup> 
New York State Militia, which had been recruited from the ranks of the 
Brotherhood, also furnished a large proportion of Meagher’s “Irish Brigade,” the 
“Corcoran Legion” and, in fact, of every Irish regiment and company engaged 
during the war. The rapid growth of the organization, however, demanded the 
increasing attention of its chief officer: and, at the urgent request of the 
Central Council, O’Mahony resigned the Colonelcy of his regiment, which was soon 
after disbanded.</font></b></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: .5in"><b>
		<font size="4">At this period the organization was rapidly augmenting in numbers 
and resources; but a coldness had sprang up between O’Mahony and Stephens, to 
remedy which envoys were sent to Ireland and mutual explanations were made which 
resulted I the promise from the Irish in America of more active aid to their 
brethren in Ireland, and on the Irish side the assurance of a speedy effort for 
National Independence. In the meantime, however, differences had arisen between 
O’Mahony and the Central Council, some of whom regarded him as too slow and 
hesitating in action; and these were referred to a general Convention of the 
Brotherhood, which was called at Philadelphia in October 1865, and was attended 
by representatives from no less than eight hundred circles, scattered all over 
the Union. At this Convention an arrangement was made by which the organization 
was to be governed, under a written Constitution, by a President and a Senate 
composed of fifteen members, whose special function was to see that the funds of 
the Brotherhood were properly applied to the object for which they were intended 
— the arming and equipping of the Irish people for the struggle for 
independence. O’Mahony was again elected President; and the prospects of the 
organization appeared to be brighter than ever. But the embers of discord were 
only covered up, not extinguished, and the flames of intestine strife soon broke 
out again. Under the influence of designing knaves, who had gained his 
confidence, O’Mahony ignored the supervisory action of the Senate, and set that 
body at defiance; and the result was a final and irreconcilable division in the 
ranks of the organization, which was fatal to its usefulness as a revolutionary 
body. The power it was capable of wielding may easily be judged from the fact 
that the Senate wing of the Brotherhood, acting under Colonel W. R. Roberts, in 
1866, with only four months of preparation, was able to put in motion against 
the British possessions in Canada, an organized force estimated by the United 
States authorities at 30,000 fighting men; while during the years from 1865 to 
the arrival of the Fenian exiles, the other wing of the organization, 
notwithstanding the wasteful and extravagant administration of the affairs, 
under a number of irresponsible and incapable leaders, who grasped at its 
control after O’Mahony had resigned it in 1866, developed evedences of strength 
and plentitude of resources that surprised its friends as much as its enemies. 
Four years ago, Colonel O’Mahony was again called to eh leadership of what 
remained of the Fenian Brotherhood; but its power had departed; other 
organizations had started up to assume the functions it exclusively fulfilled; 
and the once powerful organization was scarce a shadow of the which, a few years 
before, was ready to measure its strength against he powerful empire of Britain. 
Such as it was, however; John O’Mahony took hold of it with as simple a faith as 
when he first engaged in the work of national organization, for with whatever 
other failings he may have been chargeable, his love for Ireland was sincere and 
all absorbing, and the dream of his life was to aid, by whatever means he could 
her redemption from bondage. But his health was broken down, and his energies 
were failing. Steadily the effects of years of toil and hardship, super-inducing 
disease, told on him. He sunk at last, having lived long enough to learn that 
the Convention of the Fenian Brotherhood, which met in this city the week before 
last, had elected Jeremiah O’Donovan Rossa to the position he was no longer able 
to fill. During the latter days of his illness he was attended by the Jesuit 
Fathers from St. Francis Xavier’s Church, and by the Sisters of Charity. He 
received all the ministrations of the Church in whose faith he was brought up, 
and passed away peacefully from a world in which his life had been a stormy and 
eventful one. May his soul rest in peace. Amen.</font></b></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: .5in"><b>
		<font size="4">On the announcement of Colonel O’Mahony’s death, the Council of 
the F.B. was called together and proceed to take measures for the proper 
disposition of his remains, it was resolved to send them to Ireland for 
interment with those of his family and kindred. On the announcement of this 
determination, Mr. P.W. Gibson, the generous and public-spirited agent of the 
William &amp; Union line of steamships, at once tendered free transportation for the 
body and its escort on the splendid steamer “Dakotah,” the best vessel of the 
line, which sails on Tuesday, the 13<sup>th</sup> inst. The offer was gratefully 
accepted and arrangements were made accordingly. The officers of the Sixty-ninth 
Regiment tendered the use of their armory, in which the body could lie in state, 
and be viewed by the thousands of citizens who would naturally desire to obtain 
a last view of it. &nbsp;Accordingly, on the completion of the embalming process, the 
body enclosed in a handsome casket, were on Thursday night removed to the 
armory, and placed in the officers’ room, the flags of eh regiment draping 
coffin, on which were also placed the military cap , belt and sword of the 
deceased. A guard of honor was furnished, day and night, by the 69<sup>th</sup> 
and the “Irish Brigade;” and the room and the front of the armory have been 
draped in mourning since the arrival of the body. The flag over the armory also 
floats at half mast. The remains have been viewed by thousands of sympathizing 
patriots since their exposition.</font></b></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: .5in"><b>
		<font size="4">The remaining arrangements for the obsequies are as follows: — On 
Tuesday, 13<sup>th</sup> instant, at 9 o’clock, a.m., the body will be removed 
to the church of St. Francis Xavier, 16<sup>th</sup> street, where a Solemn Mass 
of Requiem will be offered for the repose of his soul. At the conclusion of the 
service the funeral procession will be formed, right resting on Twenty-third 
street. It will consist of the Sixty-ninth Regimen, the Veterean Corps of eh 
same regiment, the “Irish Brigade,” the various circles of the Fenian 
Brotherhood and representatives from nearly all the other Irish-American 
societies in the city and vicinity, and will escort the body through Broadway 
and Canal St., to the steamer dock at pier 46. Four representatives of the Irish 
Nationalists will accompany the remains to Ireland, and it is expected that the 
funeral pageant will be fully as imposing as that which attended the transmittal 
of the remains of Terence Belew McManus in 1861, on which occasion the late Col. 
O’Mahony aced as Chief Marshal.</font></b></p>
