      <p class="MsoNoSpacing" align="left"><span style="font-size:14.0pt"><b style="mso-bidi-font-weight:normal"><o:p></b><b><span style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal">Thanks to the kind generosity of Andrew Sweeny, whose great
          grandfather George Sweeny was an original member of the Clan-na-Gael
          Camp in Cincinnati known as the Wolfe Tone Club, I was allowed to
          transcribe the club minutes book covering January 4, 1920 to May 24,
          1926 and reproduce them here as a resource for those interested in Clan- na- Gael
      history. There is no great revelation of historical
          significance buried in the meetings of the club. However, for those
          curious about the Clan- na- Gael and how a small club operates it
          provides a significant insight. One is able to see the highs and lows
          of the club over time. Of particular interest is the process the club
          went through in joining the Friends of Irish Freedom. The Friends or
          Irish Freedom was formed by John Devoy and Denis Cohalan and the Clan- na- Gael
      just before the Easter Rising of 1916. Although the Friends of
          Irish Freedom formed as an
          open organization, the Clan- na- Gael was the birth mother and 15 of the
          17 leadership positions were Clan- na- Gael members [<i>McGarrity Papers</i>&nbsp;
          by Sean Cronin p.63].&nbsp; If one looks at the Wolfe Tone Club
          struggles to maintain itself against the backdrop of the timeline of
          Irelands struggles</span></b></span><b><span style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal; font-size: 14.0pt">
          during this period one can speculate about the effects the Civil War

      in America. One of the results was
          a split that had been building between the </span></b><span style="font-size:14.0pt"><b><span style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal"> Clan- na- Gael

          and Ireland's emerging government represented by Eamon de Valera. De
      Valera wanted to direct the Irish-American money gathering and political
      machinery but Denis Cohalan and John Devoy the two men in charge of the </span></b><span style="font-size:14.0pt"><b><span style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal"> Clan- na- Gael
      would not relinquish control</span></b></span><b><span style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal; font-size: 14.0pt">.
      Another important
          Clan na Gael leader, Joseph McGarrity of Philadelphia, tried to work
          out the differences but in the end he was forced to take sides and
      joined de Valera-ites causing an

          split became official when de Valera walked out of a meeting of the

      minutes</span></b><span style="font-size:14.0pt"><b><span style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal">.
      The Executive Board is referred to in the minutes as the &quot;DA&quot; or

      In Ireland in January of 1922
          a treaty was signed and approved between England and the Dáil Eireann
      (the newly formed Irish Parliament) which partitioned the island into two
      parts. The Loyalist Ulster section included six counties of Northern Ireland
      with rest of the counties of
          Southern Ireland being the other section. One month after the signing of the treaty the Wolfe
          Tone Club accepted an invitation to join the Friends of Irish Freedom.
          From the context of the minutes it seems clear that the Wolfe Tone
          Club stayed with the John Devoy faction of the Clan na Gael until the
      club disbanded on May 24, 1926 citing lack of interest and the necessity
          of supporting John Devoy's <i>Gaelic American</i> newspaper with additional assessments of money
          from each member. Both sides, the Loyalists in the North and the
          Nationalists in the South, were given a parliament and a form of Home
          Rule. The signing of the treaty caused a split in the Nationalist
      South between &quot;Free Staters&quot; and
          &quot;Republicans.&quot; De Valera and the Republicans disavowed the
          treaty. Civil war broke out with Michael Collins who had brokered the
          treaty with England and his followers, the Free Staters, on one side attacking de
          Valera and the Republicans, who would not accept partition under any
      context, on the other.</b></span></p>

      was a secret oath-bound society and it had two manners of
          identifying its Camps. The first was a secret designation called a Camp
      which indclued a number. Napper Tandy for example was Camp 1. The
      designation was further obscured by using a &quot;letter-following&quot;
      cipher system wherein the &quot;C&quot; for Camp became &quot;D&quot; and
      this form was used in all internal correspondence to keep
          track of the locations of the affiliated Camps. &quot;The </span></font></b><span style="font-size:14.0pt"><b><span style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal">Clan- na- Gael

      again using the letter-following code the UB was designated as the &quot;VC&quot;
      in internal correspondence. The Wolfe Tone Club as Camp D7 was originally
      designated in 1868 as Camp 10 or
          D10. In the minutes it is simply referred to as the &quot;D&quot; (see

      using the
          public name: Wolfe Tone Club. The Wolfe Tone Club was organized in January of 1868 with
          the following group of leaders for 1868 the president, called Senior
          Guardian or S.G. was William Walsh and the R.S. or Recording Secretary
          was Thomas Sheedy. The officers were elected each year. There are
          other officers in each Camp in addition to the S.G. there was a vice
          president or Junior Guardian &quot;J.G.&quot; and a Financial
          Secretary &quot;F.S.&quot; and a Treasurer as well as two or three
          &quot;Trustees&quot; which appear in the minutes. In 1869 George
          Sweeny was S.G. and J W O'Leary was R. S.. In 1870 the S.G. was Thomas
          Sheedy. In 1871 the S.G. was J W O'Leary and in 1872 the S.G. was
          William Hays. Thomas Sheedy organized a second Clan na Gael Camp
      &quot;D53&quot; in Cincinnati in August of 1869 the public name of which
      is unknown to me. The S.G. was John Geegan and the Recording Secretary was
      James Buggy. Camp D53 was consolidated with the D10, the Wolf Tone Club,
      in May 25, 1870.&nbsp;It is unknown when Camp D10 became D7 but I suspect
      it was as a result of the realignments required upon the merging of the </span></font></b><span style="font-size:14.0pt"><b><span style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal"> Clan- na- Gael
      and the United Brotherhood</span></b></span><b><font size="4"><span style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none">
      factions that formed after the split in 1885 which were reunified under
      John Devoy and Daniel Cohalan in 1900.</span></font></b></p>
          <p class="MsoNoSpacing" align="left"><b><font size="4"><span style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none"> I was able to determine later in the minutes that George
          Sweeny was member No. 1 or #1 and he was the delegate chosen in
          February of 1922 to be District Officer of the Friends of Irish
          Freedom. Sweeny apparently was the glue that held the Wolfe Tone Club
          together for whenever attendance lagged it would be Sweeny who ended up as the
          Recording Secretary again. Later on George Sweeny's son, aged 28, Colum T Sweeny
          was accepted for membership and almost immediately ended up as the
          Recording Secretary.</span></font></b></p>

          hold a meeting. Finally in May of 1926 the Wolfe Tone Club withdrew
          from the Clan na Gael and became a local social Irish Nationalist
          club. The minutes of May 24, 1926 explain this change. </span></font></b><b><font size="4"><span style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none">

              Apparently, beginning in the latter part of December of 1922,
              local lack of interest in the Clan na Gael or some sort of turmoil
              at headquarters caused the Wolfe Tone Club to cease to function.
              This paper appears to be a recapitulation of this period of
              meetings held with no quorum or no meetings held. The next page
              begins with the date “May 24”<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
              </span>year not given a committee was formed to decide whether to
              maintain themselves in the Clan na Gael or simply function as a
              local club. Later on in the minutes the date May 24, 1926 was
              given and that date seems to fit the context of this loose page.<o:p>

              George Sweeny, S.G. and Member No 1, was elected as chairman of

              Based on the previous page it is safe to assume that “George
              Sweeny” secretary protem here and “No 1” secty protem at the
              previous meeting with no action transpiring are one and the same.
              Based on the members not normally changing their numbers it may be
              safe to also assume that wherever No 1 or #1<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
              </span>appears referring to a member in this book it is George

              On February 2, 1922 the meeting minutes indicate that No. 1
              [George Sweeny] was elected District Officer of District 17 of the
              Friends of Irish Freedom organization to which the Wolfe Tone Club
              became a part of at that time whether he was still D. O. at the
              date of this meeting is unknown but “the D.O. reported” seems
              to indicate that he still was barring the unlikely prospect of
              another member having been chosen from the same club for 1923.<o:p>
