		<p align="justify"><font color="#0000FF"><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In 1874 a 
		small organization calling itself the Clan Na Gael Association outfitted 
		a whaling ship then hired an American whaling captain and crew and sent 
		the ship to Australia with the object of rescuing some Irish prisoners 
		who were serving life sentences for joining the Irish Revolutionary 
		Brotherhood (IRB) in Ireland. The IRB was an organization created with the purpose 
		of ousting the British government from Ireland. Since these men were 
		serving in Her Royal British Majesty's Army at the time, they were 
		labeled treasonous and were sentenced to serve life terms without the 
		possibility of parole. The ship was named the <i>Catalpa</i> the rescue 
		was successful when six Irish prisoners were taken from Rockingham beach in Western 
		Australia, safely loaded aboard the <i>Catalpa </i>and<i> </i>brought 
		back to America to immense joy of great crowds of Irish-American well-wishers 
		and no small pride on the part of the American people for their part in 
		the venture. The success of this expedition was the catalyst for the rise 
		of the Clan na Gael Association. </b></font></p>
		<p align="justify"><font color="#0000FF"><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Before we 
		go on with the history of the Clan na Gael, we will go back in time to 
		trace the origins of Irish-American nationalism. In 1848 an unsuccessful 
		'rebellion' took place led by men who were intellectually committed to free Ireland 
		by force of arms if necessary, but the leaders were men who lacked any 
		skill in military organization and the rising was a total failure. The 
		leaders were jailed or escaped from Ireland and came to America. Two of 
		these leaders, Michael Doheny and John O'Mahony took part in a 
		succession of small nationalist clubs, some with military units 
		attached to them, which formed, feuded, and disbanded in New York from 1848 to 
		1858. In 1858, Michael Doheny and John O'Mahony now leaders of a small 
		organization called the Emmet Monument Association, sent an envoy to 
		James Stephens, another 1848 veteran who was still in Ireland, requesting him to join 
		the Irish-Americans in a movement to free Ireland. The 
		result was two organizations with one leader, James Stephens. The two 
		organizations had different names: in America, the Fenian 
		Brotherhood and, in Ireland, the Irish Revolutionary Brotherhood (IRB). The Fenian Brotherhood was to supply the arms and the IRB was to supply the men. The formative process 
		was interrupted when thousands of Irishmen, many of them Fenians, joined 
		the North or South and fought in the American Civil War.</b></font></p>
		<p align="justify"><font color="#0000FF"><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Many men 
		were recruited in the armies during the war and when it came to an end, the focus of the Fenians returned to Ireland. 
		The British having knowledge of the Fenians intentions, struck the 
		IRB in Ireland and jailed the leaders. The effective demolishment of the 
		Irish group created a schism in the Fenian Brotherhood back in America which split in two factions, one group (the Senate wing) wanting 
		immediate action by striking the nearest accessible British soil, the 
		colonies of Canada, and the other (the O'Mahony wing) wanting to rebuild 
		the IRB 
		and strike in Ireland. The feud was intense and public, both side 
		hurling curses upon each other in the press to the delight of amused 
		American onlookers. Amazingly both groups in the same year struck 
		Canada. In April at Campobello, a small New Brunswick island, the &quot;Ireland only&quot; group, violating its 
		own philosophy, made a muddle out of the border crossing and failed to establish a foothold on British 
		soil. Two months later the &quot;Canada invasion&quot; group struck from Buffalo 
		and several other points, and although Buffalo attack on Ridgeway met 
		with some success, the United States Army cut off suplies of men and 
		material and the Fenians were forced to retire. For the more 
		observant among the Fenians, the intercession of the United States 
		military, confiscating arms and rounding up Fenians, made a clear 
		statement that the United States government, although happy to promote problems for the British, were not in the mood to annex Canada 
		or start a war with Britain. The gulf between the Fenian factions 
		widened and in the big cities of the Eastern seaboard, out in the emerging cities and farm communities in the plains, and 
		even in the gold fields and western towns on the Pacific coast small 
		groups of Fenians met with varying allegiances to&nbsp; one or another 
		faction or simply allegiance to their own internal agendas.&nbsp;&nbsp;
		</b></font></p>
		<p align="justify"><font color="#0000FF"><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In 1867, 
		one member of a Fenian Brotherhood faction, Jerome Collins, created a 
		small secret organization in New York City called the Napper Tandy Club 
		whose membership was oath-bound not to discuss the Fenian feud and 
		oath-bound to keep its proceedings secret. Included among the members 
		were leaders of the feuding Fenian factions along with other prominent 
		Irish-Americans who had remained aloof from the internecine fighting. 
		The club was successful in its objective and succeeded in remaining open to all sides. 
		Across the country small groups were founded and affiliated themselves 
		to the Nappy Tandy organization. In secret correspondence the Clan Na 
		Gael called itself the United Brotherhood and kept everything that 
		transpired 
		within their closed meetings from the national press. The Clan 
		maintained its separation from the fighting and bided its time.</b></font></p>
		<p align="justify"><font color="#0000FF"><b>&nbsp; After four more years 
		of internal Feuding, in June of 1870, a breakaway group called the 
		United Fenian Brotherhood, under the Fenian Military Council leader 
		&quot;General&quot; John O'Neill, attacked Canada in several sorties, but O'Neill 
		was captured, and another fiasco was chalked up to &quot;the men of action.&quot;&nbsp; Tamany Hall democrats wishing to keep their hold on the &quot;Irish Vote&quot; 
		paid the Fenian soldiers' train fares back to New York. The Fenians had 
		shown success in recruiting of men and arms and raising funds, but were 
		not able to achieve the same 
		success maintaining the cohesion required to make a successful 
		lightning strike in Canada that would have placed a <i>fait acompli</i> 
		in front of the U.S. government that might have, at least, garnered recognition of &quot;a belligerency 
		in control of its own territory,&quot; the phrase the British had used to 
		recognize the Southern Confederacy. A successful action in Canada 
		required an established foothold rapidly secured with sufficient force 
		to maintain itself before the inevitable lethargic United States Army 
		reaction to 
		prevent it could be mounted. Such an action required a precision in 
		planning and a unity among the participants that was lacking the 
		boisterous world of Fenainism.</b></font></p>
		<p align="justify"><font color="#0000FF"><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After the 
		1870 
		Canadian invasion took place, members of Irish nationalist clubs were crying 
		for unity. James Gibbons was the grand old man of Fenianism and the leader 
		of the Senate Fenians. Gibbons called a for an Irish National Convention in 
		Cincinnati, Ohio and invited all groups interested unification to join 
		them. The Clan na Gael whose members were in many cases also members of 
		one or another of the Fenian groups, apparently decided to take part in 
		the process for a large number of the leaders chosen at the convention were members 
		of the Clan na Gael. Although a few of the O'Mahony circles showed up, the 
		majority did not attend what was considered a &quot;Senate&quot; convention. The convention, which now 
		appeared to be a <i>de facto</i> or <i>de jure</i> cooperative venture 
		of the Senate and the Clan na Gael, sent a delegation to petition the 
		O'Mahony wing to join them and, although not really interested in the 
		unification process, the O'Mahony group allowed a negotiating team to 
		meet the Cincinnati &quot;Senate&quot; group in New York during an O'Mahony 
		Convention. An impasse occurred 
		and unification was determined to be out of the question. The Senate 
		wing, including those who were Clan na Gael members then decided to form 
		a new organization and they called it the United Irishmen. This group 
		attempted to lure the O'Mahony Fenians into its ranks, but after a year 
		of frustration the had no success. They then turned the organization over to a group of Exiled 
		Irish IRB men who freed on condition of leaving British soil, among them 
		were John Devoy, Jeremiah O'Donovan 
		Rossa, Thomas Francis Burke and Thomas Clarke Luby. The Exiles changed the name 
		from United Irishmen to 
		the Irish Confederation and attempted for two years to achieve some form 
		of unity, but the O'Mahony wing would not agree to any unification, that 
		did not admit that the O'Mahony faction was the only true Fenian 
		Brotherhood and would 
		only accept members if they joined their faction. </b>
		</font></p>
		<p align="justify"><font color="#0000FF"><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Meanwhile 
		many of the Exiled Irishmen, while they were in charge of the Irish Confederation (the old 
		Senate wing), joined the Clan na Gael and moved up through the ranks. At 
		the same time some of the Exiled Irishmen joined the O'Mahony wing and moved into 
		the hierarchy of that group. In 1874, after John Devoy presented to the 
		Clan na Gael his plan for a rescue of the military Fenians in Australia, 
		the Clan na Gael elected him chairman of their executive. The success of 
		the rescue of the military Fenians, in 1876, brought smaller factions 
		into the Clan na Gael and the Clan emerged as the representative of 
		&quot;physical force nationalism&quot; or the policy of support for an&nbsp; 
		insurrection in Ireland. The O'Mahony wing of the Fenian Brotherhood 
		continued on for years until 1880 but every year its membership dwindled. 
		O'Donovan Rossa started his own group, again called United Irishmen, and was thrown out of the Clan na 
		Gael for this breach of the Clan constitution, but his group soon died 
		away also. By 1880 the Clan na Gael was the spokesman of physical force 
		nationalism. John Devoy and Doctor William Carroll, a Philadelphia 
		protestant, ran the Clan na Gael until 1880. In 1878 Devoy and Carroll 
		decided to support the Michael Davitt and his Land League in Ireland. 
		The League gained a large support but after Davitt was arrested and with 
		the emergence of Charles Stewart Parnell who was more a political animal 
		than a revolutionary, first the IRB and then the 
		Clan na Gael began to lose interest. The moderate Clan leaders, Devoy 
		and Carroll, were sidelined by new &quot;men of action&quot; leaders, Alec Sullivan and Michael Boland, these 
		later two intended to use the Clan na Gael funds for planting bombs around 
		England. After they gained control of the Clan na Gael they in fact 
		began what was called the Dynamite War, and a few explosions occurred 
		but the bombers were mostly caught before they could place their 
		devices. Spies in the Clan, probably agents provacateurs were in the 
		Clan were on the British payroll. The bombings alienated the IRB in Ireland 
		and started a feud within the Clan na Gael in America. </b></font></p>
		<p align="justify"><font color="#0000FF"><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Back in 
		England a spy named Henri LeCaron, an O'Mahony Fenian who joined the 
		Clan na Gael as a friend of Sullivan's, testified in open court in 
		England. Le Caron presented secret Clan documents in an attempt to prove 
		that the Clan na Gael bombings were sponsored by, or approved by, Land 
		League leader Charles Stewart Parnell (who was actually innocent). Back 
		in America, Devoy and another 
		moderate Clan member, Dr. Patrick Cronin, began a campaign 
		to oust Sullivan and Boland. Cavalier use of Clan money by Sullivan and 
		his breaking ties with the IRB without notifying the Clan membership created enough scandal in the Clan to 
		muster the support to bring 
		Sullivan before a Clan trial. Sullivan was exonerated by the Clan executive 
		in the trial but Cronin and Devoy would not give up. Cronin threatened 
		to publish the notes he had taken at the trial and Sullivan told his 
		supporters 
		that Cronin was an English spy in cahoots with Le Caron. In 1889, Sullivan's 
		backers in Chicago murdered Cronin and suddenly the Clan na Gael was no 
		longer a secret society as one after another secrets on inner Clan 
		doings in Chicago were published as part of the trial, adding to the previously published 
		information from the trial in England. Although originally hauled in for 
		questioning, no evidence that Sullivan was in on the murder was found. 
		The Clan was now in a shambles.</b></font></p>
		<p align="justify"><font color="#0000FF"><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Clan 
		na Gael was reunited under John Devoy a couple of years later and 
		provided money to support Sinn Fein during the events in Ireland which led 
		up to the Easter Rising of 1916 and then up to the time where Ireland became a 
		partitioned free state. The Clan na Gael under different names such as 
		Noraid and others supported Sinn Fein up until the Friday Peace accords 
		in Ireland. Where the Clan stands today is unknown to myself.</b></font></p>
