<blockquote>
    <p><strong>The name Hendricks is Dutch and may be spelled
    Hendrik, Hendrix, Hendrick. James Hendricks and his wife Jane
    landed at Jamestown, VA from Holland. The First Generation in
    America. By the Fourth Generation, Thomas Wayman Hendricks
    was born Jun 25, 1835, died Feb 8, 1865. He married Dec 18,
    1856 to Eliza Jane Deaver (1840-1912). He had children:
    Benjamin Franklin, Mary, Martha, Eliza , and Thomas. David
    Hendricks, the original Hendricks to come to Blount Co.
    settled in Blountsville, AL in the late eighteen thirites or
    early forties. He came from Pickens Co. SC, and had a large
    family. It is the general belief that the early Hendricks
    were Methodist. They were pious, upright citizens. They were
    not slave owners, but some of them had a house servant or
    two.</strong></p>
    <p><strong><br>
    Thomas Wayman Hendricks is the writer of the Cherished
    Letters. He had brothers, David Addison (was a Methodist
    minister), Lemuel Levert (died of fever in the trenches near
    Murphreesboro, TN during the War), Lihugh (died of TB), James
    (died in young manhood), and sisters Sarah (died when a baby)
    and Jane (died when small). </strong></p>
    <p><strong>Thomas Wayman Hendricks entered the Civil War on
    August 19, 1862. He was a volunteer and fought nobly for the
    Southland until he was killed by the Yankees, Feb 8, 1865. He
    was a cavalryman in Company B, 12th Alabama Regiment, with
    his cousin, John David Hendricks as his lieutenant and
    Mr.Augustus (Gus) Ingram as his captain. He was in General
    Wheeler&#146;s Army. He was shot by the Yankees while on
    scout duty at Pole Cat, South Carolina, near Savannah, GA. He
    was sent out on scout duty by Sergeant Levi Stephens, who
    took charge of Lieutenant Hendricks men, when he Hendricks
    and some of his men were cut off from the main army for a day
    or two. Mr. George Clowdus, a cousin of Thomas
    Hendricks&#146; wife, was with him when he was killed and
    related the incident leading to his death. He said the little
    scouting party ran into the Yankees before realizing that the
    Yankees were so near. They ran from the Yankees down a long,
    sandy road, on each side of which were thick, scrubby, black
    jack oak trees and bushes, which made taking to the woods
    difficult. The sandy road slowed the horses terribly, but
    Thomas&#146; horse was making good progress. Mr.
    Clowdus&#146; horse was rapidly losing ground when Thomas
    called back, &quot;Take to the woods George, take to the
    woods,&quot; but his horse would not go through the scrubby
    oaks, so Mr. Clowdus waved a white handkerchief, but the
    oncoming Yankees shot him anyway. He lay on the ground until
    morning, then he crawled down the road a short distance where
    he found Thomas Hendricks&#146; body. The Yankees had killed
    him and completely rifled his pockets. Lt. John David
    Hendricks was terribly hurt over Thomas&#146; death. He said
    he would never have sent the men out on a scouting expedition
    if he had been with them. </strong></p>
    <p align="left"><strong>Jane Deaver Hendricks was a noble,
    Christian lady. Meek, modest, unassuming, yet strong in
    purpose, determination and convictions of right, she walked
    steadily and firmly, under her heavy cross of widowhood,
    through the dark days of Reconstruction, and the years that
    followed There were no words of self pity or complaint,
    rather there was humble submissiveness to God&#146;s will and
    cheerful following of His further guidance. When on furlough
    once, Thomas had sold their farm and bargained for another
    near his father and mother to protect his family, but when he
    went to close the deal for the farm he wished to buy, the
    owner decided not to sell. Greatly disappointed, he had to
    return to the army before locating another desirable farm.
    Jane kept the Confederate money for which their farm sold
    until the war ended, hoping that her husband could come home
    and select a good farm. When the war ended the money was
    worthless. Her brothers wanted to give her some land
    adjoining their land on the Warrior River, which was a part
    of the Deaver estate. It was on this land near the present
    town of Locust Fork in Blount county that she reared her
    family. Her son Franklin was plowing at nine years of age. He
    was unusually dependable as he grew up and assumed his duties
    and responsibilities manfully. He loved his horses and gave
    them the best of care. Their home was a veritable beehive of
    industry. Spinning, weaving, sewing and knitting were daily
    activities, and many yards of cloth came from their loom
    including double woven counterpanes, coverlets, and blankets.
    They wove the cloth for nearly all of their clothes. There
    were many pretty quilts too. Saturdays were very busy days.
    There were wooden pails, piggins, trays, churns and floors to
    be scrubbed with white sand, yards to be swept and baking for
    Sunday to be done. There was much hard work, too hard for
    young shoulders, but no shoulders ever carried their loads
    more courageously, more dutifully, or more willingly than did
    these four children. Despite their tragic loss and the hard
    work which was their lot in life, there existed a joyous
    peace and happiness in their home that was seldom equaled.
    Many fine people enjoyed the hospitality for which their home
    was noted. They were all regular attendants of their church,
    Cumberland Presbyterian services, as well as the services of
    other nearby churches. The four children grew into fine,
    Christian young people, whose friends and associates were
    numbered with the best people of the county. From among these
    friends they selected their life companions and established
    four Christian homes.</strong></p>

    <p align="left"><strong>Calhoun County, Camp Hunley,<br>
    September 18th, 1862<br>
    Mrs. E. J. Hendricks,<br>
    Kind and Affectionate Wife:<br>
    It is with pleasure this evening that I answer your very kind
    letter<br>
    sent by J.D. I was very glad to heare from you that you and
    the children<br>
    were all better. I hope by this time you all are sound and
    well. You<br>
    cannot imagine how bad I want to see you all. It seems like I
    have been<br>
    from home a month. But I must tell you something about the
    times here. I<br>
    tell you we have all been mad since we came here. Col. Hunley
    in his<br>
    report to the war department reported me, J.D. &amp; some 20
    others in other<br>
    companies in this Battalion.<br>
    <br>
    But the most of us have been changed back, I told Capt.
    Ingram if he<br>
    did not get me back I would go home at the risk of my life. I
    tell you<br>
    Jane, I never was so mad in my life. It was a general
    complaint but the<br>
    boys are getting some what calm. My mess are all in Capt.
    Ingram&#146;s Co.<br>
    together, except H. Chany. He is in Capt. Horton&#146;s Co. I
    and my mess will<br>
    stick together, let come what will, I think though all will
    be quiet in a<br>
    few days. Our mess are all satisfied, I believe. I expect Wm.
    Steel will<br>
    take Chany&#146;s place in our mess. I have been very harty
    since I have been<br>
    here. I have been well all the time &amp; you had better
    believe that I made<br>
    those potatoes get away that you sent to me by J.D. They were
    so good &amp; nice.<br>
    <br>
    Jane, I cannot describe how bad I want to see you and my
    little<br>
    children, Pa &amp; Ma, D.A. &amp; family and in fact all in
    the neighborhood, but I<br>
    must tell you I expect if I keep my health it will be months
    first. Col.<br>
    Major Hunley said this evening we would leave here next
    Saturday morning at<br>
    8 O&#146;clock for Knoxville, TN. I expect furloughs will be
    very hard to get.<br>
    Charley stands it fine. The horses were all valued today. I
    believe<br>
    Charley was valued to $200. We have a nice place to camp. We
    are at a<br>
    camp ground. We stay under the arber. We have fine water and
    plenty of<br>
    it. I was sorry to here of my mules jumping in peoples corn.
    You dun<br>
    just right when you put them up. I don&#146;t want them to
    pester anybodys<br>
    stuff. If you can&#146;t get $220 or $225, just keep them.
    Jane feed them<br>
    shoats well and try to make your meat out of them and that
    old sow. I know<br>
    you will take the best care you can of what little we have
    got. I will<br>
    draw no money here. They say we will get it at Knoxville.
    There are about<br>
    five companies here. Tell Pa I can make out without him
    trying to bring<br>
    provisions to me so far. As for my fodder I know Pa will do
    all he can and<br>
    Jane I want you to pay him for his labour and trouble. We
    never can know<br>
    how much he and Ma have done for us. I want them repaid.<br>
    Friday Morning, 19th:<br>
    all well this morning. Our neighbor boys are all right this
    morning. I<br>
    have as much baggage as Charley aught to carry. I expect you
    had better<br>
    write as soon as you get this unless you want for me to wait
    again, but if<br>
    you write as soon as you get this, direct your letter to
    Knoxville, TN.<br>
    I do not know how long we will stay there. I do not know
    whether we will<br>
    go by where L.L. is or not. I hope we will have to go that
    way. I have<br>
    not heard from him since he left home.<br>

    <p align="left"><strong>Knoxville, Tennessee<br>
    Sept. 29th, 1862<br>
    Kind and Respectable Father and Mother,<br>
    With reverence and respect I attempt to write you a few
    lines. I am in<br>
    common health at this time although I am somewhat fateagued
    by our long<br>
    march. We got to this place last eavening we was nine days on
    the road<br>
    from camp near Gadsden. We had a verry dusty time in
    marching. Well, I<br>
    tell you Brother L. L. is in two miles of our camp. We had
    not been here<br>
    more than two hours before he got the news and here he came.
    You cannot<br>
    imagine how much good it done me to see him. I went over to
    his camp this<br>
    morning. It is 2 miles from here. The 41st Ala. Regt. Left
    this morning<br>
    to go north, I suppose to Kentucky. There are several
    thousand over there<br>
    yet. L. L. said he exspected they would all leave there in a
    few days maby<br>
    tomorrow, so I do not know whether I will get to see him any
    more or not<br>
    before he leaves. L. L. says he is as well as common he
    looked about the<br>
    same. I seen the Algood boys and W. Roberson &amp; W.
    Hargraves also. There<br>
    was none of our Blount boys there exscept the convalescents.
    I saw Isaac<br>
    Self over there. He was well as common. They think the 19th
    Ala Regt. Is<br>
    in Kentucky. They exspect to have to foot it all the way from
    here to<br>
    Kentucky. I tell you it makes feel sorry for them no one but
    a soldier<br>
    knows what we all have to go threw. We have had tolerable
    plenty to eat<br>
    some times our horses do not fair so verry well. Charley
    stands it as well<br>
    as any of them. Cousin S. M. is still verry bad off at Tyners
    station 12<br>
    miles from Chatanooga. L. L. said he passed by there 8 or
    nine days ago<br>
    but the car never stopped and so he did not get to see S.M.
    atal. We will<br>
    draw our tents this eavening or tomorrow and they say we will
    draw our<br>
    bounty money in a few days. I do not know how long we will
    stay here. I<br>
    don&#146;t think we will stay more than a week or two. When
    we leave heare, I<br>
    exspect we will go to Kentucky. Pa, I want you to try to
    manage for Jane<br>
    the best you can what ever you think is best do it and I know
    Jane will be<br>
    satisfied with what you think is best. Just manage my things
    like they<br>
    were your own. Sell my hens the verry best you can and if
    Jane thinks<br>
    best, you can sell one cow, but if you think the milk cows
    can be wintered<br>
    I think it would be best for Jane to keep them. Pa and Ma, I
    am trying to<br>
    do the verry best I can for myself, and I want you to
    remember me when it<br>
    goes well with you. As I want to write a few lines to Jane, I
    will close<br>
    this. I remain as ever your obedient son till death.<br>
    Thos. W. Hendricks<br>
    I would like to get a letter from you.</strong></p>
    <p align="left"><strong>My ever dear and affectionate wife,<br>
    I cannot fold this letter without dropping a few lines to you
    in answer to<br>
    your verry kind and welcome letter you sent by Mr. E.
    Washburns. I was<br>
    glad to heare you and the children were all well. If I cannot
    get to see<br>
    you it does me good to just here that you are all well. It
    seems like it<br>
    has been a long time since I left home but this is nothing
    but a breakfast<br>
    spell to what I exspect it will be before I get an
    opportunity of going<br>
    home. I think in about 8 or 10 days we will leave here for
    Kentucky. The<br>
    enemy are giving back and we will have to follow them up. I
    tell you Jane<br>
    if you do not get many letters from me, don&#146;t think hard
    for a soldier does<br>
    not have as much time and chances to write as you would
    suppose but you may<br>
    be assured I will write as often as I can. I wrote to you
    from camp near<br>
    Gadsden just before I left there and I will write again
    before I leave<br>
    here. Tell Brother D.A. and family I have not forgot them yet
    and that I<br>
    will write to them before six days if nothing happens. Tell
    him to write<br>
    to me wheneaver he thinks a letter will reach me. I
    don&#146;t exspect we will<br>
    be stationed long at any one place.<br>
    Jane, you can see what I have wrote to Pa about managing our
    stock and<br>
    other things. Take his advice and do the best you can as for
    sowing wheat<br>
    pa knows that is best. Try and hire some one to plow and swap
    work with Pa<br>
    in sowing wheat. You will have to rent land to sow on. Hire
    your wood<br>
    hauled and cut up. I do not want you to exspose yourself in
    cold wet<br>
    weather. The neighbor boys are all well at this time. They
    are writing<br>
    letters this eavening as well as me, that is some of them at
    least.<br>
    Tell Franklin, Mary and Martha I have not forgot them yet and
    give sweet<br>
    little Sissa a ciss for me as I have to write on a log and it
    is getting<br>
    late, I will close.<br>
    Your<br>
    affectionate Husband,<br>
    Thos.<br>
    W. Hendricks<br>
    Jane, I will send you some paper the first chance.<br>
