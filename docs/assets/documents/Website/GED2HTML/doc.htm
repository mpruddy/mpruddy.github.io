<H2>Overview</H2>

GED2HTML is a program that inputs genealogical data in GEDCOM format,
and outputs a collection of HTML files suitable for presentation on
the World Wide Web.  The input format it accepts is based on the
<A HREF="http://www.gendex.com/gedcom55/55gctoc.htm">GEDCOM 5.5 standard</A>.
The output produced consists of HTML files containing the individual
data, an index suitable for quickly locating an individual by name,
an auxiliary surname index with links to the first individual
with each surname, and a special index file suitable for use by automatic
indexing programs such as the
<A HREF="http://www.gendex.com/gendex">
<EM>GENDEX</EM> WWW Genealogical Index
</A>.
The output is highly configurable.  Each data file can contain a single
individual or multiple individuals.  Either a hierarchical or a flat
index can be specified.  Files can be organized into subdirectories or
a flat collection.  In addition, the HTML output is programmable,
so that the format of the HTML files can be changed by the user.

This is copyrighted software.
You are encouraged to copy and share this software, subject to the
specific conditions detailed <A HREF="#copying.html">here</A>.
You are permitted to evaluate this software free of charge for a period
of no more than fourteen days.  To use this software for longer than
fourteen days, or to use it for anything other than evaluation purposes,
requires written permission from the author.  Such permission
may be obtained by paying to the author a registration fee. <P>

I can now offer you three ways to pay the registration fee.
By far the fastest and easiest way for you as well as for me is for you
to pay using the <A HREF="http://www.kagi.com/">Kagi</A>
Web page at: <A HREF="http://order.kagi.com/?ES&S">
<CODE>http://order.kagi.com/?ES&amp;S</CODE></A>.
Kagi is a payment processing service I have engaged for this
purpose.  They forward the payment to me after taking a commission of
a few percent and also deducting the fees charged by the credit card company.
To use the Kagi Web page, you must pay by credit card, and you must
supply them an E-mail address they can use to sent you your registration
acknowledgement after your payment has been processed.
Generally, this will occur within 24 to 48 hours after you submit
your payment.  <P>

A second way to pay, which anyone can use, is to remit payment to Kagi
using the REGISTER.EXE program that is packaged together with the
Windows distribution of GED2HTML.  With this method, you may send payment
in a variety of forms, including credit cards via FAX, and personal checks
via postal mail.
Kagi will send you an acknowledgement either by E-mail (preferred)
or via the postal service, and will forward the payment to me after
deducting their commission.
To pay this way, simply run the REGISTER.EXE program, fill in the form,
and send the payment as instructed.
When you pay using this method, you should allow sufficient time
(perhaps a week, depending on where you are mailing it from)
for your payment to reach Kagi, a few days for Kagi to process your
payment (depends on the form of payment -- see Kagi's Web page for details),
and sufficient time for the acknowledgement to reach you again.  <P>

A third option is to send payment directly to me.  To do this, you
must be able to procure a money order or check drawn on a US bank
(personal check is OK) for $20 US currency.  Please make funds payable
to "Eugene W. Stark" and mail payment to me at the following address:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Eugene W. Stark
<BR>
14 Landing Lane
<BR>
Port Jefferson, NY 11777
<BR>
USA
</BLOCKQUOTE>
You can also send me a US $20 bill, however you should wrap it in paper
and be aware that there is some risk involved in sending cash through
the postal service.  My bank can also handle checks written in Canadian
currency, for a fee of $2 US, so if you wish to pay that way you can do
it, but please send an amount in $CDN that will cover the exchange and
the fee.  <P>

When I receive your registration fee, I will send you an acknowledgement
of your registration, and place you on a mailing list to receive announcements
of future updates to the program.  You will also receive a password
that will enable you to download the full version of the program
from <A HREF="http://www.gendex.com/download/">here</A>.
The full version of the program does not produce the UNREGISTERED message
in the output files that the "demo" version of the program produces.
Your registration fee entitles you to use any updated version of the program
I release within two years of receiving your fee. Your registration fee helps
me to justify spending time improving this program and responding to
E-mail from users.  Thanks! <P>

GED2HTML: About the Program

<A NAME="about.html">
GED2HTML: About the Program
</A>
</H2>

This program reads GEDCOM files as input and produces a set of HTML files,
each file containing information from one or more individual records in
the GEDCOM input.  The information for each individual contains hypertext
links (relative URL's) to the files for the parents, spouses, and children
for that individual.  Birth, marriage, and death events are included in the
file, as are notes records associated with the individual, and source
information.  A sorted, hierarchical index can also be created, with
a hypertext link to each individual.  The program can be instructed to include
``pedigree charts'' with each individual, to facilitate navigation between
individuals.  The program can also automatically insert additional HTML text
into each individual file.  This feature can be used to add additional text,
images, audio, or whatever else you want to each individual.  Moreover, you
only have to create the ``include files'' for the individuals on which you have
extra information, and you can maintain all your other data on whatever system
you are using to produce the GEDCOM output.  If you get an updated GEDCOM file,
simply go to the directory where the individual include files are stored
and run GED2HTML again.  It will update each individual file with the new
GEDCOM data and will automatically insert the additional HTML text from the
include files. <P>

I wrote the original version of this program because I wanted an easy way
to convert my own GEDCOM data to HTML for presentation on the World Wide Web.
Version 1 of GED2HTML, written for Unix in early 1994, was built around a
YACC parser.  This version was based on the GEDCOM 5.3 draft standard.
A Windows 3.1 version was created in late 1994, and a user-configurable output
template language was also added at that time.  As I gained experience with
how GEDCOM is actually used in practice, I realized that the YACC-based parser
was too inflexible to handle the full variety of GEDCOMs that actually exist.
So for GED2HTML version 2, released in mid-1995, I wrote a new parser that
would accept essentially "any" GEDCOM file, and would only complain about
grossly malformed input.  Since Version 2.0 many people have used this program
to place their family history databases on the World Wide Web.  Version 2.5b,
released in April, 1996, was a particularly long-lived and successful
version. <P>

Version 3.0 of GED2HTML incorporated yet another major revision of the
program.  I undertook this revision because I wanted to accomodate
better the newly adopted GEDCOM 5.5 standard, but could not do so in
a reasonable way without redesigning the core of the program.
In addition, the template language used in version 2 was incredibly
cumbersome and difficult to use, and I felt the complexity of the output
templates was limiting my ability to handle the additional information
that could be incorporated into a GEDCOM under the 5.5 standard.
Version 3.0 featured a newly designed output language that can actually
be programmed by mere mortals, including me. <P>

Well, at least me.  One of the disadvantages of the new output language
is that you pretty much have to be a programmer to make any kind of
substantial changes to the output format.  Regrettably, the situation has
not improved much in subsequent versions.  In the current version (3.6),
the standard output program is itself over 3300 lines of code!
However, the output language introduced in version 3.0 has given me
the flexibility to accomodate many of the suggestions that I have received
from users of the program over the past few years.  It seems that my
"to do" list is never empty, but I feel that I have continued to make
many substantial improvements in the program since version 2.5b.  <P>

Over the course of its lifetime, GED2HTML has been used in a variety
of ways.
However, at present most people are using this program as a ``black box''
for quickly transforming their GEDCOM data into a form suitable for
presentation on the World Wide Web.
A good starting point for finding many of these databases is the
<A HREF="http://www.gendex.com/gendex/">GENDEX index server</A>,
which at the time of this writing provides links to data pages on over
14 million individuals in over 3800 databases,
a large percentage of which were processed into HTML using GED2HTML.
The largest database that I know about that has been processed with GED2HTML
(running under FreeBSD Unix) is a huge file that contains data on over
319,000 individuals in over 3.5 million lines of GEDCOM.
I have used versions of this program to prepare my own much more modest data
(about 1000 individuals) for presentation on the World-Wide Web.
You can view the results by starting from
<A HREF="http://www.gendex.com/users/stark/family_history/">here</A>.
From my GEDCOM file, I produced approximately 700 individual files,
which are linked together among themselves and to my hypertext family
history document. <P>

Though versions 2.3a and earlier of this program were released as freeware,
around the time of the release of version 2.3a I realized that I was spending
quite a bit of time responding to E-mail from users of the program.
From the E-mail correspondence, it became clear that much better documentation
was required.  Besides that, the program itself had grown, revisions were
starting to take more time, and had become a bit less fun and more work.
I also began running the <A HREF="http://www.gendex.com/gendex">
<EM>GENDEX</EM> WWW Genealogical Index</A> site on the World Wide Web to try
to establish a central index of as much as I could of the data on the Web that
was prepared using GED2HTML program (and other compatible software).
To justify the amount of time I was spending on this work, I decided
that GED2HTML version 2.4 and all subsequent versions would be released as
shareware. <P>

Over the past few years I have corresponded with hundreds of people about
this program, and quite a number of them have sent me useful suggestions
which I have tried to incorporate into the current version.  Though it would
be impossible for me to name everyone from whom I have received a valuable
suggestion, I would like to convey special thanks to Birger Wathne for
contributing useful ideas and code for the first versions of this program,
and to a number of other users (including, but not limited to,
Annelise Anderson, Allyn Brosz, Susie and Kerry Jane Dunavant, Bob Fieg,
W. Wesley Groleau, Brian Mavrogeorge, Steve Messinger, Mike Schwitzgebel,
and Doug Smith) of various early versions of the program who took the trouble
to send me their bug reports and problematic GEDCOMs.
Special thanks to Jean-Philippe Ménard for the French translation,
Wilm Boerhout for the Dutch translation,
Peter Springer-Ferazin for the German translation,
Olav Overdahl for the Norwegian translation,
Ezio Ajmar for the Italian translation,
Lars Blomberg for the Swedish translation,
Jørgen Bak for the Danish translation,
Matti Rekunen for the Finnish translation,
Janez Toplisek for the Slovenian translation,
Armando Schaun for the Portuguese translation, and
Christo Viljoen for the Afrikaans translation.
I am very grateful to Annelise Anderson for her beta testing efforts
of version 3.0, which found a number of horrible bugs that I don't want to
talk about.
I'd also like to thank everyone else who sent me registration fees,
along with their kind words that make all the work I did on this program
worthwhile. <P>

<A NAME="whatsnew.html">
GED2HTML: What's New in the Current Release
</A>
</H2>

<B>Version 3.6</B>: <P>

This release consists of incremental updates and improvements I have
been making since the release of version 3.5 a year and a half ago.
The following changes were made since version 3.5e:
<UL>
<LI> I've decided to discontinue support for the Windows 3.1 version.
	I apologize to those who are still using Windows 3.1, but,
	hey, even Microsoft doesn't support it anymore.  <P>
<LI> The documentation is now accessible from the program via a "HELP" button,
	using the standard Microsoft "HTML Help" viewer.  <P>
<LI> New option variables <CODE>INCLUDE_PATH</CODE>,
	<CODE>INCLUDE_IMAGE_EXT</CODE>, and
	<CODE>INCLUDE_INFO_EXT</CODE> were added.
	The <CODE>INCLUDE_PATH</CODE> variable is a string that is
	automatically prepended by the standard output program
	to the GEDCOM identifier (RIN) for an individual,
	to construct the name of an associated external file to be
	included in the HTML output.
	The default value is the empty string.
	The <CODE>INCLUDE_IMAGE_EXT</CODE> and
	<CODE>INCLUDE_INFO_EXT</CODE> variables are strings that are
	automatically appended by the standard output program to the
	RIN.
	The default values are <CODE>.img</CODE> and <CODE>.inc</CODE>,
	respectively.
	The <CODE>INCLUDE_IMAGE_EXT</CODE> variable is for the first include,
	which is intended to be used to include an image of an individual.
	The <CODE>INCLUDE_INFO_EXT</CODE> variable is for the second include,
	which is intended to be used to include additional information
	about an individual. <P>
<LI>  A new <CODE>.exists</CODE> qualifier was added for string
	values.  If <CODE>x</CODE> denotes a string, then
	<CODE>x.exists</CODE> evaluates to non-null if the string
	is the name of an existing file, otherwise to null.
	The behavior of <CODE>include</CODE> was changed so that
	an error message is produced if an attempt is made to
	include a nonexistent file.
	The standard output program was modified to test whether
	a file exists before attempting to include it. <P>
<LI>  New option variables <CODE>IGNORE_NOTES</CODE> and
	<CODE>IGNORE_SOURCES</CODE> were added.
	If set to non-null, then the program will completely
	ignore any notes or sources in the input GEDCOM, other
	than <CODE>!LIVING</CODE> notes.
	This behavior is different from the previously existing
	<CODE>GENERATE_NOTES</CODE> and <CODE>GENERATE_SOURCES</CODE>
	variables, because the latter variables only suppress the
	production of separate notes and sources files, but left the
	links intact in the other pages. <P>
<LI>  Processing was added for the fields
	<CODE>NPFX</CODE>, <CODE>GIVN</CODE>, <CODE>NICK</CODE>,
	<CODE>SPFX</CODE>, <CODE>SURN</CODE>, and <CODE>NSFX</CODE>
	of the <CODE>NAME</CODE> structure.
	These fields were previously ignored. <P>
<LI>  Processing was added for the fields
	<CODE>ADR1</CODE>, <CODE>ADR2</CODE>, <CODE>CITY</CODE>,
	<CODE>STAE</CODE>, <CODE>POST</CODE>, and <CODE>CTRY</CODE>
	of the <CODE>ADDR</CODE> structure.
	These fields were previously ignored. <P>
<LI>  An option was added to put dates on the pedigree chart.
	The production of dates is controlled by the new option
	variable <CODE>PEDIGREE_DATES</CODE>, which has the default
	value 1, meaning that dates are produced.
<LI>  New qualifiers <CODE>.christening</CODE> and <CODE>.burial</CODE>
	were added for individual values.  These produce events
	similarly to the previously existing <CODE>.birth</CODE>
	and <CODE>.death</CODE> qualifiers. <P>
<LI>  A new statement, <CODE>deftag</CODE>, was added to the output
	language.  The syntax is
	"<CODE>deftag &lt;id&gt; &lt;expr&gt;</CODE>,
	where <CODE>&lt;id&gt;</CODE> is a GEDCOM 5.5 tag
	(such as <CODE>INDI</CODE> or <CODE>BIRT</CODE>)
	and <CODE>&lt;expr&gt;</CODE> is an expression that evaluates
	to a string.  The effect is that the default print name
	for the specified GEDCOM tag (such as "Individual" or
	"Birth") is replaced by the new string.  This construct
	can be used by the end user to customize the GEDCOM tag
	names that get printed out with events; for example, if the
	user does not agree with the particular default translation
	of the tag name in a particular language. <P>
<LI>  A new option variable <CODE>NO_LDS_ORDINANCES</CODE> was added.
	If nonzero, then the production of output corresponding
	to LDS ordinance information is suppressed.
	The default value is zero. <P>
<LI>  Support was added for producing Slovenian output. <P>
<LI>  Support was added for producing Portuguese output. <P>
<LI>  Support was added for producing Afrikaans output. <P>
<LI>  The method of sorting individuals in the index was modified so
	that individuals with identical names are sorted chronologically
	according to any available date information. <P>
<LI>  The default output program was changed so that pedigree charts
	will not be printed for an individual if there is no information
	about that individual's mother or father.
<LI>  A problem was corrected in which the output interpreter failed
	to interpret array subscripts correctly. <P>
<LI>  A bug was corrected that was causing the date in the "Created by"
	page footer to come out in the US English locale instead of any
	specified locale. <P>
<LI>  The old locale names used under FreeBSD were updated to those
	currently in use in FreeBSD 3.x. <P>
<LI>  A problem was corrected with the interpretation of GEDCOM dates that
	used the <CODE>FROM</CODE> and <CODE>TO</CODE> keywords. <P>
<LI>  A bug was fixed that caused extra junk to be left at the end of
	a text field when <CODE>@</CODE> was used in the GEDCOM. <P>
<LI>  The method for converting strings to upper case was modified
	to have the correct results for accented letters.
	This conversion should now work correctly, at least for languages
	that use the ISO-8859-1 character set.  Slovenian is the only
	supported language so far that does not use this character set. <P>
<LI>  Various minor corrections and improvements were made in the
	standard output program. <P>
</UL>

<B>Version 3.5e</B>: <P>

Another mostly bugfix release that supersedes version 3.5d.
The following changes were made since version 3.5d:
<UL>
<LI>  Incorrect codes in internal tables for the ANSEL character set
	were corrected.  This problem caused certain international
	characters, including "es zet", slash o, thorn, ligature ae,
	and various other symbols, to appear incorrectly in the output
	for certain GEDCOMs. <P>
<LI>  Some minor changes were made to the Swedish language tables.  <P>
<LI>  Failure of GED2HTML to correctly interpret dates with trailing
	spaces was corrected.  <P>
<LI>  A missing comma was added to the output program.  This was causing
	a mysterious "00" to be output after the LDS "Temple" tag.  <P>
<LI>  Father, mother, and child links from family group sheets were
	changed to point to places that were a bit more reasonable.
	In particular, an attempt is made to always point such links
	to the most suitable family group page, if such exists,
	giving preference to a page that records the marriage of the
	target individual over one that records that individual as
	a child.  <P>
<LI>  Code was added to the output program to link to notes and sources
	for "Married:" events, the same was as was already done for
	"Born:" and "Died:" events.  <P>
<LI>  Finnish was added to the list of supported languages. <P>
<LI>  Some little-used and/or old GEDCOM tag names that appeared to
	be coded incorrectly in internal tables were corrected.
</UL>

<B>Version 3.5d</B>: <P>

Another bugfix release that supersedes version 3.5c.
The following problems in version 3.5c were fixed:
<UL>
<LI>  A problem was corrected that caused the alphabetical index tabs not
	to point correctly to the proper surnames in case there were
	null surnames in the GEDCOM input. <P>
<LI>  A problem was fixed in which children's marriage date/place information
	was coming out blank in the parents' family group sheet. <P>
<LI>  In family group sheets, father/mother links now point to the
	page for the correct marriage, rather than to the first marriage
	for the specified individual.  <P>
<LI>  Superfluous blanks that were being output in the gendex.txt file
	were removed.  <P>
<LI>  A bug in the output language that prevented subscripted variables
	from working properly was corrected. <P>
</UL>

<B>Version 3.5c</B>: <P>

Another bugfix release that supersedes version 3.5b.
The following problems in version 3.5b were fixed:
<UL>
<LI>  The "standard.g2h" output program was reworked to fix
	brokenness in the support of the INLINE_NOTES option,
	and to make the INLINE_NOTES and INLINE_SOURCES options
	behave like the documentation says they are supposed to.
	<P>
<LI>  A problem was fixed in the "standard.g2h" output program
	that caused it to fail during generation of the alphabetical
	surnames index in cases where there were individuals
	with no surnames.  <P>
<LI>  The error message claiming that a date is
	"missing non-GEDCOM-5.5-compliant: was toned down to state
	only that the the date is "missing or uninterpretable".
	This is because there are a couple of constructions
	in GEDCOM-5.5 dates that GED2HTML does not yet understand,
	so it seems best not to declare arrogantly that they
	are not GEDCOM-5.5-compliant. <P>
<LI>  The behavior of the GED2HTML.EXE dialog screen was changed
	so that selecting an options file through the use of
	the BROWSE button causes that options file to be loaded
	immediately.  The failure of this loading to occur has
	confused many people in the past.  <P>
</UL>

<B>Version 3.5b</B>: <P>

This additional bugfix release supersedes version 3.5a.
The following problems in version 3.5a were fixed:
<UL>
<LI>  A problem was fixed in which the day of the month portion
	of dates failed to appear in the HTML output. <P>
<LI>  A problem was fixed that caused error messages and failure
	of the program to generate output when the SURNAME_WIDTH
	parameter was set to a nonzero value.  <P>
<LI>  A problem was corrected that caused children in family
	group sheet output to be listed with the same marriage
	place as their parents. <P>
<LI>  The number of error messages printed out in case of
	non-GEDCOM-5.5-compliant date strings was limited,
	with full details going to the error file. <P>
</UL>

<B>Version 3.5a</B>: <P>

This bugfix release supersedes version 3.5.  The following problems
in version 3.5 were fixed:
<UL>
<LI>  A problem was fixed in which notes that had CONC in them
	were being truncated after two lines. <P>
<LI>  A workaround was implemented for the situation in which the
	GEDCOM file contains non-GEDCOM-5.5-compliant date formats.
	(Brother's Keeper appears to be a significant culprit here.)
	GED2HTML v3.5 would silently interpret such dates incorrectly.
	Version 3.5a now complains loudly about the incorrect date
	format, and then simply uses the date string verbatim, rather
	than trying to interpret it.  This means that non-compliant
	dates will not be translated according to the selected
	output language or locale.  <P>
<LI>  A mistake was corrected regarding the transmission of the
	"Output Program File" parameter between the GED2HTML.EXE
	dialog screen and the G2H.EXE program.  The dialog screen
	was using the old parameter name TEMPLATE_FILE, rather
	than the new parameter name OUTPUT_PROGRAM.  <P>
</UL>

<B>Version 3.5</B>: <P>

It's been a long time since version 3.1a, and as I've made a fairly
substantial number of improvements, I've bumped the version number
several notches.  I didn't go all the way to 4.0, though,
because the changes to the program are primarily evolutionary,
rather than revolutionary.  The following summarizes the most important
changes.  There have also been many other minor changes and fixes.
<UL>
<LI>  The family group sheet output format has been integrated into
	  the standard output template program, and it is selectable
	  via the "Additional Options" field of the dialog box.  <P>
<LI>  A number of parts of the GEDCOM 5.5 specification that were not
	  handled before, or were handled only minimally, are now handled
	  more fully.  This includes sources and source citations,
	  as well as repository information. <P>
<LI>  Dates in the GEDCOM are now interpreted by GED2HTML, if possible.
	  This enables dates to be produced in the HTML output in a
	  format appropriate for the desired output language
	  (English, French, <EM>etc.</EM>) <P>
<LI>  The separate output programs for each individual output language
	  have been merged into a single standard program.  This makes it
	  possible to change the output language via program options,
	  without having to also use a different output program.
	  The disadvantage is that the standard output program is now
	  a daunting piece of code of over 2500 lines, which probably
	  makes it fairly difficult for non-programmers to make
	  substantial modifications.
	  <P>
<LI>  The output template now provides some control, via options
	  variables, of whether notes and sources appear on the same
	  page as the individual or family to which they pertain,
	  or else on a separate notes page.  <P>
<LI>  For surname indexes that aren't too long, the standard template
	  now uses an alphabetical style that seems to be popular
	  on the Web.  To support this, the output template language
	  was extended with comparison operators on both integer
	  and string values.  <P>
<LI>  Some non-backward-compatible changes were made to the output
	  language in order to support some of the new features in
	  this release.  These changes primarily have to do with the
	  additional of additional types of values, and changes in
	  the meanings of certain qualifiers.  If you have made substantial
	  customizations to the output program, you will want to review
	  the <A HREF="#language.html">output language definition</A>. <P>
</UL>

<B>Version 3.1a</B>: <P>

It's sort of embarrassing to issue a new release a few days after
a previous release, but in this case I had to do it because of a bug
in the new "automatic living detection" feature that could potentially
cause me to get a lot of E-mail.
<UL>
<LI> A bug was fixed that prevented many dates from being interpreted
	correctly, which would in turn cause individuals that should
	have been presumed "living" not to be flagged properly. <P>
</UL>

<B>Version 3.1</B>: <P>

This release consists of minor bug fixes and changes I introduced in response
to E-mail from users, plus a new experimental output format, ability to
process LDS ordinance information, and a feature for automatic flagging of
"living" individuals.
<UL>
<LI> A bug was fixed where when an individual had multiple NAME records,
	the last one was chosen as the primary name, rather than the first. <P>
<LI> The standard template was modified to add an indication of whether
	the family line continues with a child. <P>
<LI> A new experimental template "famgrp.g2h" was added, which produces
	the individual data pages in "family group" format, much in the
	style of another popular GEDCOM to HTML converter program.
	Although the fact that I could code this template illustrates
	the flexibility of the GED2HTML output processor, it wasn't as
	straightforward as I would have liked.  In the future, I will be
	looking into generalizing the output language to make it easier
	to generate output formats radically different than the "original"
	GED2HTML format. <P>
<LI> Some problems with umlauts in ANSEL-encoded GEDCOMs were fixed. <P>
<LI> Processing was added for LDS ordinance information. <P>
<LI> A bug was fixed that caused a GPF or invalid page fault when
	processing a GEDCOM that had undefined cross-reference links
	to individuals. <P>
<LI> Several new options variables were added that make it easier
	to set background colors or images on the generated HTML pages.
	 <P>
<LI> Added a feature by which GED2HTML will automatically presume a
	person to be living if they are born after a specified year
	and have no explicit death information. <P>
</UL>

<B>Version 3.0b</B>: <P>

<UL>
<LI> Support for output in German and Norwegian has been added. <P>
<LI> The program is now somewhat more forgiving in case there are
	undefined cross-reference ID's in the GEDCOM.  Previously,
	it would often terminate prematurely in the output phase.
	Now, it should complete producing the output files in most
	situations. <P>
<LI> A bug was fixed that prevented options beginning with a digit
	from being recognized as strings, even when there was a
	preceding double quote. <P>
<LI> Some improvements and extensions to the standard template program. <P>
</UL>

<B>Version 3.0a</B>: <P>

This version incorporates a few bug fixes and extensions since
version 3.0.  Specifically, the following changes were made:
<UL>
<LI> The processing of "individual attributes", such as EDUC, RELI, RESI,
	was broken.  These should now work much better. <P>
<LI> The GED2HTML dialog box would mysteriously fail to save options
	settings in certain situations.  This was due to a parameter
	being set too low, which limited the number of changed options
	that could be recorded in an options file to 10.  I have now
	increased this parameter to 100. <P>
<LI> I got rid of a long directory name (templates) that was causing
	certain unzip programs to choke on the distribution file.
	The template directory is now called "template". <P>
</UL>

<B>Version 3.0</B>: <P>

Version 3.0 represents a major rewrite of a large portion of GED2HTML.
The main objective of this rewrite was to modify the internal design of the
program to obtain flexibility for accomodating the GEDCOM 5.5 standard
as fully as possible.  There were three main problems with the old design
that stood in the way of doing this: (1) the output template language was
too complicated, making it infeasible to add further features or information
to the output pages; (2) the internal data structures could not accomodate
the additional information allowed by GEDCOM 5.5 without using excessive
amounts of memory; (3) the method of specifying program options was too
complicated and <EM>ad hoc</EM> to support the introduction of additional
options for output customization.  The following is a brief summary of the
main changes in functionality between 2.5b and 3.0:
<UL>
<LI> The output template language has been completely redesigned.
	The new language is much more like an ordinary programming language,
	and it actually has some features for finding errors in templates
	before they are run, as well as for debugging templates while they
	are running.  The several output templates that existed in the
	previous version have been combined into a single template, and
	recoded in the new language. <P>
<LI> The method by which customization options are set has been completely
	revised and made more uniform.  Nearly all options are now controlled
	by setting variables in the output template interpreter.
	Many more customization options were added. <P>
<LI> Under Windows, the GED2HTML.EXE dialog box has been redesigned
	and substantially extended, so that essentially any program option
	can be set from it.  It is now possible to save options settings
	to a file and recall them on a later run, making it much easier
	to associate a different collection of options settings with
	each GEDCOM one might wish to run.  The dialog box has been
	enhanced with "Browse" and "Save As" common dialog boxes for
	specifying the GEDCOM, options, and template files. <P>
<LI> The program now has a native Windows 95 version, as well as a
	Windows 3.1 version.  The Windows 95 version is several times
	faster than the Windows 3.1 version. <P>
<LI> An attempt has been made to make GED2HTML compatible with the
	current GEDCOM 5.5 standard.  Besides INDI and FAM, both
	both NOTE and SOUR at level zero are now fully supported.
	Though other level-zero records permitted by GEDCOM 5.5 are
	not yet supported, the internal design of the program has
	been reworked so that it should be much easier to add support
	for these records in future releases. <P>
<LI> Support for several character sets other than ISO-8859-1 has
	been added.  In particular, the program should now do a reasonable
	job with international characters encoded in ANSEL,
	ISO-8859-1, and IBMPC character sets under DOS code pages
	850, 863, and 437. <P>
<LI> The program now supports output in French and Dutch as well
	as in English. <P>
<LI> A two-level hierarchical surnames index is now supported, to
	reduce the size of the surnames index files for very large
	databases. <P>
<LI> Notes and sources files can be split up into pieces, so that
	each piece is a manageable size. <P>
<LI> The registered and "demo" versions are now identical, except
	for the following:  (1) the demo version outputs an
	UNREGISTERED message on each HTML output page; (2) substitution
	of new output template programs is not supported in the demo
	version; (3) the demo version will read in, but not produce
	output for, GEDCOMs containing over 5000 individuals. <P>
<LI> It is now possible, using an option setting, to switch between
	the hash-based assignment of individuals to files and directories
	of version 2.5b, and the alphabetical assignment used in
	older versions.  This should alleviate a common complaint
	about 2.5b.<P>
<LI> The behavior of the !LIVING feature has been placed under the
	control of the output template program.  The default behavior
	is to output the name of a living individual, but no other
	information.  More or less information can be included by
	changing the output template program.<P>
<LI> Better error messages are produced in response to problems with the
	GEDCOM being processed. <P>
<LI> It is now possible to access some of the information in the
	0 HEAD GEDCOM header record. <P>
</UL>

<B>Version 2.5b</B>: <P>
<UL>
<LI> Fixed bug (again!) which caused earlier Windows versions to look
	for <CODE>!INCLUDE</CODE> files in either the directory below
	(versions earlier than 2.5) or above (versions 2.5 and 2.5a)
	the directory where the documentation says it looks.
<LI> Fixed a bug which caused surname ``JAMES'' to appear before
	surname ``JAME'' in the index.
<LI> Fixed a bug in the that was causing links between sources to fail.
<LI> Fixed an omission from the output templates that was causing
	sources associated with family events not to appear in the
	HTML output.
<LI> Added some documentation about international character sets, and
	revised some other parts of the documentation.
</UL>

<B>Version 2.5a</B>: <P>
<UL>
<LI> Fixed -w 0 option so it works instead of crashing the program.
<LI> Added a trailer line to the GENDEX files to help in detecting
	truncation.
<LI> Added Kagi Shareware REGISTER.EXE program to provide additional
	ways to pay the registration fee under Windows.  This should
	make it feasible and convenient for non-US users to pay by
	credit card.
</UL>

<B>Version 2.5</B>: <P>
<UL>
<LI> Revamped the scheme for assigning individuals to subdirectories
	and files within subdirectories.  The new scheme calculates
	the particular directory and file in which to put an individual
	from the individual's cross-reference ID, so the same individual
	will always end up in the same directory and file as long as
	the same number of directories and number of files per directory
	are used.  A new option (<CODE>-D n</CODE>) was added to allow
	the user to specify the number of directories to be used.
	This should make it possible to link to individual pages from
	external documents, and	have these links remain valid when the
	GEDCOM is re-processed, even if individuals have been added to
	the GEDCOM since the first run.
<LI> Added the following feature to aid in eliding information about
	living persons:  If an 0 INDI record for an individual contains
	a field that begins 1 NOTE !LIVING, then all personal data is
	deleted from that individual's page and the only information
	that is output is the text of the note.
<LI> Eliminated large array allocation that was effectively limiting
	the number of individuals that could be processed to 16384
	under Windows.
<LI> Changed the option syntax for dumping compiled-in templates
	so that it can actually be used under Windows to dump templates
	to a file.
<LI> Fixed a problem with empty surnames generating multiple entries
	in the surnames index.
<LI> Fixed a problem under Windows, where files to be included in the
	HTML output were being looked for in the wrong directory.
<LI> The GENDEX.txt index files now use christening date/place if
	no birth information is available, and burial date/place if
	no death information is available.
</UL>

<B>Version 2.4c</B>: <P>
<UL>
<LI> Fixed bug that could cause infinite looping at end of file on some
	Unix systems, and caused weird syntax errors when 8-bit characters
	occurred in GEDCOM files under Windows.
<LI> Fixed bug where the alternate index and surname template fields were
	interchanged in the GED2HTML.EXE dialog box under Windows.
<LI> Windows executables are much smaller, and probably run a bit faster,
	due to the use of different compiler options.
</UL>

<B>Version 2.4b</B>: <P>
<UL>
<LI> Introduced changes that cut memory usage in half, and also significantly
	boost performance.
</UL>

<B>Version 2.4a</B>: <P>
<UL>
<LI> Some progress printout was added to the Windows version,
	because people were mailing me telling me that the program
	had hung up, when in fact it was just taking a long time.
</UL>

<B>Version 2.4</B>: <P>
<UL>
<LI> GED2HTML is now being released as shareware.
	Please see <A HREF="#registering.html">here</A>
	for more information.
<LI> <EM>New documentation</EM> has been written in HTML.
	You're reading it.
<LI> The DOS version of the program has been discontinued.
	Only the Windows version is in the current release.
	The DOS version was pretty useless for GEDCOM's of any
	interesting size, anyway.
<LI> A true Windows user interface is now provided to make it
	easier and less confusing for most Windows users to run
	the program.
<LI> <EM>Source records</EM> are now supported.  Previous versions of the
	program would only include source information at level 1
	within INDI records.  Furthermore, full source structures
	were not supported.  The Version 2.4 handles cross-referenced
	source records at level 0, as well as source structures
	within INDI, FAM, NOTE, and event structures at higher levels.
	The existence of source information is signalled in the output
	file by ``footnote markers'' that appear near the information
	to which they pertain.  The footnote markers link to source
	information in separate HTML files.
	The chaining of source structures, as described in the
	<A HREF="gedstand.t82">GEDCOM 5.3 draft standard</A>,
	is also supported, but it is not thoroughly
	tested since I do not have sample GEDCOMs that use this feature.
	At present, only source structures chained to other source
	records are handled.  Chaining of source structures to event
	records, though allowed by the GEDCOM 5.3 draft standard,
	will result in an error message.
<LI> <EM>Performance improvements</EM> have been made in the production
	of the output files, especially under Windows.
<LI> <EM>OCCU, EDUC,</EM> and a variety of other tags giving information
	about an individual are now processed properly, and the information
	appears in the output files.
<LI> <EM>Pedigree charts</EM> have been changed slightly to be
	a little more compact at depths of 4 or greater.
<LI> <EM>PERSONS.html</EM> is now the name of the top-level index file,
	rather than <EM>INDEX.html</EM>.  The latter was an unfortunate
	choice that conflicted with defaults built into many Web servers.
<LI> <EM>Titles of individual pages</EM> now include birth and death dates.
<LI> <EM>New template constructs</EM> have been added to cause the date
	of the run and the version number of GED2HTML to be inserted into
	the output.
<LI> <EM>The Windows version</EM> of the program now creates its output
	files in a subdirectory HTML, rather than in the directory from
	which it was run.
<LI> <EM>The hierarchical index algorithm</EM> was modified to try to
	reduce the frequency of index nodes with hardly any entries in
	them.  The current scheme adjusts the width of the index nodes
	less than the specified maximum width, so that all the nodes at
	the same level of the index have close to the same number of entries.
	Under certain conditions the top-level index node can still end
	up with as few as two entries, but this can be worked around
	by adjusting the specified maximum width until better results are
	obtained.
<LI> <EM>A few minor bugs were fixed</EM> that existed in the previous
	version of the program.

</A>
</H2>

Unix binaries are available for various combinations of GED2HTML versions
and target platforms.  If a registered user asks me, and I can get access
to an ANSI C compiler on the appropriate type of platform, I am generally
willing to compile up a binary of the current GED2HTML version to run on
that platform.  If you are a registered user, and you don't see what you
want below, <A HREF="mailto:ged2html@gendex.com">mail me</A> and ask me
whether I can create the binary you want.
Please note that I have no plans to distribute any sources other than the
old GED2HTML v2.4a source distribution listed below. <P>

</H2>

<H3>Downloading and Unpacking the Distribution</H3>

The Windows 95/98/NT and Windows 3.1 versions of GED2HTML are distributed
as a file GED2HTML.ZIP.
If you don't yet have this file, you first have to
<A HREF="#downloading.html">download</A> it.
After downloading, you should have a file GED2HTML.ZIP in a convenient,
otherwise empty folder somewhere.
To unpack the distribution you will need an unzip program.
If you already have a recent PKZIP-compatible unzip program,
you can probably use that to unpack GED2HTML.
If you don't have an unzip program, or if for some reason your unzip
program fails to properly unpack GED2HTML, download the (free) InfoZIP "WiZ"
program that is also available via the GED2HTML downloading page.
<P>

Note that the InfoZIP "WiZ" program is distributed as a single file
<CODE>wiz401xN.exe</CODE> which is a "self-extracting archive".
To unpack it, you just put this file in an otherwise empty
directory, and launch it, either by double-clicking on its name
or icon under Windows Explorer, or else by typing its name at the
MS-DOS prompt.  It should unpack itself and create a number of
files, including the application <CODE>wiz.exe</CODE>.
Launching <CODE>wiz.exe</CODE> will bring up a screen that you
can use to unzip GED2HTML.
There are help files distributed with "WiZ" that you can read if it
is not clear how to use it.
 <P>

To unpack GED2HTML, launch your unzip program and specify the filename
<CODE>ged2html.zip</code> as the file to be unpacked.
Alternatively, you could try double-clicking directly on
<CODE>ged2html.zip</CODE> and when the system asks you what application
you would like to associate with files with extension <code>.zip</code>
you can specify your unzip program.
In either case, once GED2HTML is unpacked, you should have a number
of files in the folder with the GED2HTML.ZIP.
Among the files you now have are the following executables:
<OL>
<LI>  REGISTER.EXE
<LI>  GED2HTML.EXE
<LI>  G2H.EXE
</OL>
At this point, you don't need GED2HTML.ZIP any more, so if you like,
you can move it to a safe, out-of-the-way place in case for some
reason you want to start all over again.
The program REGISTER.EXE can be used to register your copy of the program
using the <A HREF="http://www.kagi.com">Kagi</A> shareware payment
processing service. See <A HREF="#registering.html">here</A> for details
on how to register. <P>

The file GED2HTML.EXE is the Windows user interface for GED2HTML,
and it is what you should use to launch the program.
This user interface simply collects your options in a dialog
box, and then starts G2H.EXE, which is the "back-end" program that
does all the real work.  Since (unlike previous versions of GED2HTML)
all the options understood by G2H.EXE can now be accessed via the GED2HTML.EXE
interface, there is probably no need for you ever to run G2H.EXE directly.
However, please note that for proper operation, GED2HTML.EXE has to be
able to find G2H.EXE, and thus either both must reside in the same
directory or else you will have to modify properties settings for GED2HTML.EXE
so that it starts in the directory where G2H.EXE is located, or use some
other Windows trickery to arrange that GED2HTML.EXE can find and launch
G2H.EXE. <P>

<H3>Running GED2HTML with the Default Options</H3>

As discussed above, the program GED2HTML.EXE is what you should use to
start GED2HTML.  Launch GED2HTML.EXE by double clicking on its icon
either from the file manager (under Windows 3.1) or from Windows Explorer
(under Windows 95/98/NT).  A dialog box should appear with various
fields and buttons.  If you wish to run GED2HTML with the default options,
then all you have to do is enter the name of the GEDCOM file you wish to
process in the "GEDCOM File" field, either by typing it directly into
that field or using the "BROWSE" button to select the file.
Then, click on "OK".
At this point, the dialog box should be replaced by a console window
and processing of your GEDCOM should begin.  If, instead, you get a
message box telling you that G2H.EXE could not be executed, check to make
sure that G2H.EXE resides in the same directory or folder as GED2HTML.EXE.
<P>

As your GEDCOM is processed, you will see various progress messages
output in the console window.  First the GEDCOM is read, then the
individuals are sorted and index files are output, then sources and notes
files are output, then the individuals are resorted, and finally
the individuals files are created.  When processing has finished,
you will see the message "Processing complete".  Under Windows 95/98/NT you
should press ENTER to close the console window.  Under Windows 3.1
the word FINISHED will appear in the lower left-hand corner of the
window, and you will have to close the console window using the
system menu. <P>

By default, the HTML files produced by GED2HTML are placed in a
subdirectory "HTML" of the directory from which it was started.
You may peruse the files with your Web browser to verify that they
are OK.  Good starting points are the files "PERSONS.HTM" and
"SURNAMES.HTM" (under Windows 95/98/NT, "persons.html" and "surnames.html"). <P>

Exactly how long it will take to process your GEDCOM is primarily
dependent on whether you have enough RAM on your system for the size
GEDCOM you are attempting to process.  Roughly speaking, this generally
amounts to about one megabyte of RAM per thousand individuals in your
GEDCOM.  Thus, a 10,000-individual GEDCOM could be processed comfortably
in 10MB of RAM.  In this case, the program will spend most of its time
generating the output files, rather than reading the input data.
As the ratio of individuals to RAM approaches one megabyte of RAM per
two thousand individuals, the program will become slower and slower
at reading in the GEDCOM file, and will make extensive use of the disk.
In this case, during certain phases of program execution where the
individuals are sorted, it may appear that the program is "hung".
Most likely it isn't; rather, it is just busy trying to shuffle your
data back and forth between disk and RAM.
It is probably not feasible to process a GEDCOM if there are more than
three thousand individuals per megabyte of RAM. <P>

<H3>Customizing GED2HTML Output</H3>

If you don't like some aspect of the HTML output produced by GED2HTML,
it can probably be changed.
The output of GED2HTML can be customized through the use of a large
number of <EM>options settings</EM>, which are described
<A HREF="#customizing_windows.html">here</A>.
Another form of output customization you can do without supplying any
options whatsoever is to include additional HTML text at two fixed points
in the individual files.  How to do this is described
<A HREF="#inlining.html">here</A>.
Finally, the output format can be completely changed by modifying the
GED2HTML <EM>output program</EM>.  How to do this is described
<A HREF="#templates.html">here</A>.  <P>

Running the Unix Version of GED2HTML

</H2>

<H3>Downloading and Unpacking the Distribution</H3>

The current Unix version of GED2HTML is distributed in two parts:
a generic distribution, which consists of everything except the binary
executables, and a platform-specific distribution, which contains only
the GED2HTML binary for a particular architecture and operating system.
You must first <A HREF="#downloading.html">download</A> both of these
parts. <P>

If what you really wanted was source, please note that the only source
version that I am currently distributing is GED2HTML version 2.4a.
If you want to play with source code to this old version, go ahead and
<A HREF="#downloading.html">download</A> it, but as I am no longer developing
or supporting this version, you are pretty much on your own.
You will need an ANSI C compiler (such as GCC) and a "make" utility to compile
the program.  Old non-ANSI C compilers will not work, sorry.
Also, you may have to do various kinds of tweaking to the C preprocessor
#define's or the Makefile to get the source to compile on your particular
system.  Many times this is due to lack of ANSI compliance of the compiler
being used.  <P>

The generic distribution of GED2HTML comes in the form of a gzipped tar
file, so you will need "gunzip" and "tar" (standard tools on most Unices)
to unpack the distribution.  After downloading, you should have a file
"g2hdocs.tar.gz".  First, uncompress it using the command:
<LISTING>
	gunzip g2hdocs.tar.gz
</LISTING>
Make a subdirectory "ged2html" (call it whatever you want)
into which to unpack the distribution.  Go to that directory and execute:
<LISTING>
	tar xvf ../g2hdocs.tar
</LISTING>
At this point, you should have a number of files, which constitute the
complete GED2HTML distribution, except for the executable program itself. <P>

The GED2HTML executables for the various platforms are distributed as
gzipped binary files.  For example, after downloading the executable for
a SparcStation running Solaris 2.4, you might have a file
"ged2html_v2.5b_solaris5.4.gz".  Put it in the same directory where you
unpacked the current distribution and uncompress it using the commands:
<LISTING>
	gunzip ged2html_v2.5b_solaris5.4.gz
</LISTING>
Install the resulting GED2HTML binary anywhere you want, as long as the
directory where you install it is in your default shell search path. <P>

<H3>Running GED2HTML with the Default Options</H3>

GED2HTML is invoked, as are all Unix commands, by typing its name,
possibly followed by command-line arguments.  Command line arguments
that begin with '-' signify processing options.  Following the processing
options are zero or more filename arguments.
If no filename arguments are supplied, then GED2HTML assumes it is to
read GEDCOM from the standard input.  Otherwise, it reads the specified
GEDCOM files, one after the other, merging all the data and outputting
a single set of HTML files.  To run GED2HTML with the default options on
a single GEDCOM file "myged.ged", you would type:
<LISTING>
	ged2html myged.ged
</LISTING>
<P>

In keeping with the Unix tradition of terse programs, the Unix version
of GED2HTML does not print many comforting messages as it reads your data
and writes the output files.  The only message printed is a single
line output after GED2HTML has finished reading your GEDCOM, but before
it begins creating the HTML files.  This message reports the number of
lines of GEDCOM that were processed, and how many of each different kind
of record (individual, family, note, <EM>etc.</EM>) were encountered. <P>

By default, the HTML files produced by the Unix version of GED2HTML are
placed in the current directory.  You may peruse the files with your Web
browser to verify that they are OK.  Good starting points are the files
"persons.html" and "surnames.html". <P>

Exactly how long it will take to process your GEDCOM is primarily
dependent on whether you have enough RAM on your system for the size
GEDCOM you are attempting to process.  Roughly speaking, this generally
amounts to about one megabyte of RAM per thousand individuals in your
GEDCOM.  Thus, a 10,000-individual GEDCOM could be processed comfortably
in 10MB of RAM.  In this case, the program will spend most of its time
generating the output files, rather than reading the input data.
As the ratio of individuals to RAM approaches one megabyte of RAM per
two thousand individuals, the program will become slower and slower
at reading in the GEDCOM file, and will make extensive use of the disk.
It is probably not feasible to process a GEDCOM if there are more than
three thousand individuals per megabyte of RAM. <P>

Output Files Produced by GED2HTML
</A>
</H2>

GED2HTML produces a number of output files and subdirectories.
Under Unix, the default behavior is for output files and subdirectories to be
created in the current directory.
Under Windows, the default behavior is for output files and subdirectories
to be created in a subdirectory HTML of the directory from which
GED2HTML is started.
On both systems, it is possible to override this default, and cause the
output to be placed in some other directory.
See <A HREF="#customizing.html">here</A> to find out how to do this. <P>

The following is a description of the various output files and directories
produced by GED2HTML:
<UL>
<LI> <B>persons.html</B> (PERSONS.HTM under Windows 3.1) <P>
	This file is the top-level file of the hierarchical index
	of individuals.  It can be used as an entry point to the
	database.
	If you specified a flat index,
	then entries for all the individuals appear in this file
	in alphabetical order.
	Otherwise, this file contains links to sub-index containing
	ranges of names, which point ultimately to the individual
	data pages. <P>
<LI> <B>indxxxx.html</B> (INDxxxx.HTM under Windows 3.1) <P>
	These files, which are present if you elected to use a hierarchical

<LI> <B>surnames.html</B> (SURNAMES.HTM under Windows 3.1) <P>
	This file contains a list of all the surnames in the
	database, with links into the lowest-level index pages.
	This file can also be used as an entry point to the
	database. <P>
<LI> <B>surxxxx.html</B> (SURxxxx.HTM under Windows 3.1) <P>

Uploading GED2HTML Output to your Web Provider
</TITLE>

<BODY>

<H2>
<A NAME="uploading.html">
Uploading GED2HTML Output to your Web Provider
</A>
</H2>

Once you have run GED2HTML to create the HTML output files
and you have checked these files by viewing them with your HTML browser,
you will probably then want to upload these files to a Web provider,
so that they can be served up on demand to other people on the Internet.
Exactly how this is achieved is not something that I can give detailed
instructions about, because it depends very strongly on the details
of the service you receive from your Web provider.
However, there is a bit of general strategy that always applies,
and this is what I discuss below. <P>

The output of GED2HTML on a typical GEDCOM can be a very large number
(thousands) of files and directories.  Uploading each of these files
individually to a Web provider would be an incredibly time-consuming
and tedious task that is to be avoided at all costs.  Similarly,
performing any kind of individual editing on every file output by GED2HTML
is also generally not feasible.  About the only thing that it might be
feasible to do (and sometimes necessary) is to systematically rename
all the output files from GED2HTML, for example to change the filename
extensions from .HTM to .HTML.
Even this is to be avoided if at all possible. <P>

To avoid having to upload individual files, the following general strategy
is applied to get the files (and directories) from your system to your
Web provider's system:
<OL>
<LI> First, an <EM>archiver</EM> is used, to package up all the files
	and directories output by GED2HTML into a single "archive" file.
	Examples of archivers are various versions of ZIP, as well as
	the Unix program "tar". <P>
<LI> Next, the archive file is uploaded to your Web provider's system,
	typically using FTP, but perhaps Kermit or Zmodem.  Usually,
	archive files are binary data, so when using FTP it is important
	to select "binary" or "image" mode when uploading them. <P>
<LI> Finally, the archive file is unpacked into place on your Web provider's
	system.  This requires that an "unarchiving" program, complementary
	to the one you used to create the archive, be available on your
	Web provider's system, and that also you have sufficient access
	to your Web provider's system (typically a "shell account") to be
	able to run the unarchiver on that system.
</OL>
Some good advice is to work out the whole procedure using a small GEDCOM,
so that you don't waste a lot of time uploading megabytes upon megabytes
of data until you are pretty sure the whole thing is going to work in
the end. <P>

One big thing that can go wrong with the above strategy is that you
might not have shell access to your Web provider's system.
In that case, all bets are off, and you will have to check with your
Web provider's technical support staff to find out what might be the
best way to get the GED2HTML output files and directories from your
personal computer to the Web provider's system.
Often the best strategy in this case is to use a good FTP client
such as <A HREF="http://www.ipswitch.com/products/ws_ftp/">WS-FTP</A>
that is capable of uploading multiple files without manual intervention.
<P>

<H3>What Archiver to Use?</H3>

If you do have shell access, then one question you have to work out
is which archiver to use.  Probably any decent system these days
will have an "unzip" program available, so your best choice would
probably be to use some form of PKUNZIP or compatible.
My recommendation is Info-ZIP "WiZ", which is a very nice, free
ZIP/UNZIP program, with a GUI.  The Windows 95/NT version understands
long filenames.
I have made available for download
<A HREF="http://www.gendex.com/download/utils/wiz401xN.exe">
wiz401xN.exe</A> for Windows 95/NT, and
<A HREF="http://www.gendex.com/download/utils/wiz401x.exe">
wiz401x.exe</A> for Windows 3.1.
These are self-extracting archives, which unpack themselves on your
system when they are launched from an otherwise blank folder.
Versions of Info-ZIP software are also available for Unix systems.
For more information about Info-ZIP, and for the most recent
releases, see <A HREF="http://www.cdrom.com/pub/infozip/">here</A>.)
<P>

Note that when unpacking a ZIP archive with a program such as
PKUNZIP, it may be necessary to tell the program to preserve the
directories (folder) organization the files originally had when
they were created by GED2HTML.  When using PKUNZIP to unpack
the archive, this is done by giving the "-d" parameter on the command line.
When using WinZip to unpack the archive, the "Use Folder Names" box
should be checked to do the same thing. <P>

Another alternative is the classic unix "tar" archiver.
Many Web providers are Unix-based systems,
and essentially every Unix system has the "tar" program available,
so using "tar" to create the archive is often a viable option.
You can download a TAR.EXE for use under DOS or Windows from
<A HREF="#downloading_win31.html">here</A>.
(Note that this version of TAR.EXE is a DOS program that doesn't
understand Windows 95 long filenames.  There may be more up-to-date
versions available on the 'net, but I haven't looked recently.)
<P>

Use the DOS command
<LISTING>
	TAR cvf HTML.TAR HTML
</LISTING>
(note that the ``cvf'' must be in lower-case letters)
to create a binary file ``HTML.TAR'' containing the contents of the
entire ``HTML'' subtree.  On your service provider's system, execute
<LISTING>
	tar xvf html.tar
</LISTING>
to unpack the file and recreate the ``HTML'' subtree.
Note that if you packaged up your data as suggested above, then when
you unpack your data, the ``HTML'' directory will be created in the
directory from which you run ``tar''.  Thus, you want to make sure you
are in the directory where you want the ``HTML'' subdirectory to go
before you unpack your data.
<P>

<H3>Can't Use Subdirectories</H3>

Some major online providers do not allow users to create subdirectories
in their Web directory.  If you subscribe to such a provider, all is not
lost, because GED2HTML can be instructed to produce a "flat" set of
output files that does not use subdirectories.  Simply set the
"Number of files per directory" option to zero to disable the use of
subdirectories. <P>

You should be aware that, with a GEDCOM of any significant size, GED2HTML
will produce a great many output files.  One reason why GED2HTML uses
subdirectories in the first place is that it can be somewhat
inconvenient to manipulate a directory containing several thousand
files.  In addition, under Windows accessing such directories becomes
very slow.  If you ask GED2HTML to create a "flat" file structure,
be aware that it could take substantially longer to create your
HTML files, and that dealing with the resulting directory might be
a bit cumbersome. <P>


<H3>
<A NAME="lowercase">Upper-case Filenames and Lower-case Links</A>
</H3>

Another common thing that goes wrong is for people to find that,
once they have uploaded all their files and unpacked them on their Web
provider's system, the hyperlinks within the HTML files don't work
because the files all end up having upper-case names on the Web provider's
system, whereas all the links in the HTML files are in lower case.
This type of problem is unavoidable when files are transferred from
a case-insensitive operating system like DOS (Windows 3.1) to a case-sensitive
operating system like Unix.  The uploading program or unarchiver that is
used has to make some decision about how to render the upper-case only
DOS names as Unix names.  Two natural choices are (1) to render all such
names in upper case on the Unix system, and (2) to render all such names
in lower case on the Unix system.  Windows 95 has introduced a third,
not so natural, choice, which is to render all such names as mixed upper
and lower case, where the first letter is capitalized, and the remaining
letters are in lower case. <P>

One way to get around this problem, should you encounter it, is to see
if the uploading program or unarchiver you used has an option that allows
you select whether DOS files are unpacked with upper-case or lower-case
names.  If so, that may be the fastest way out.  If not, then
GED2HTML is now fully configurable to handle this type of situation.
If you find that files are ending up on your Web provider with all
upper-case names, then set the "Case-fold-links" option of GED2HTML to
"Upper" before processing your GEDCOM.  This will cause GED2HTML to
make all the links in the HTML output upper-case only, so that they
will work properly once the whole batch of files arrives on your provider's
system.  If you find that files are ending up on your Web provider with
all lower-case names, then set the "Case-fold-links" option of GED2HTML
to "Lower".  If both your system and your Web provider's system are
case-sensitive systems, then setting "Case-fold-links" to "None" is
probably the option for you.
See <A HREF="#customizing.html">here</A> for more details on this, and
other customization options provided by GED2HTML. <P>

<H3>
<A NAME="renaming">
HTM versus HTML
</A>
</H3>

There is another technical problem that you might encounter when you have
uploaded your data and you begin to try to access it via the Web.
The symptom of this problem is that your Web browser will apparently
not recognize your uploaded files as HTML code, and will instead display
them as plain text.  The cause of this problem actually involves the
configuration of the Web server on your provider's system, in a way
that is explained below. <P>

When you create HTML files under Windows 3.1, all the files are created
with a .HTM extension, because DOS only supports three-letter filename
suffixes, and will truncate anything longer than that.
When run under Windows 3.1, the default behavior of GED2HTML is to use
a .HTM extension for all the hyperlinks internal to the output files,
in order to be compatible with the .HTM extension with which the files
are created. <P>

When you upload files created under Windows 3.1 to your provider's system,
everything will be fine as long as the HTTP (Web) server running on your
provider's system is set up to recognize files ending in .HTM as HTML source
code.  The server passes this information along to your browser, which
formats displays the information properly.
However, not all HTTP servers are configured to recognize files ending
in .HTM as HTML files.  In this case, the server will tell your browser
that the file is text, and it will not be properly displayed. <P>

The simplest way out of this predicament is to ask for the cooperation
of your Web service provider.
Web servers generally have a "mime.types" configuration file,
which lists mappings from filename extensions to MIME types.
This information allows the server to determine what kind of
information is in a file by looking at the extension.
The server communicates this information to your browser when
the file is retrieved, and the browser, in turn, uses the
information to control how the file is displayed.
Some servers lack an entry:
<LISTING>
	text/HTML	htm
</LISTING>
in this file, which would tell them that files ending in ".htm"
are to be interpreted as HTML source.
What you need to do is to ask your friendly Web service provider
to add the above entry to the server "mime.types" configuration
file.  Usually they will agree to do this for you, as it doesn't
have any bad effect, and it will generally help out DOS users
who are uploading HTML from their PC's.
<P>

Although many Web service providers will make the configuration change
described above, some providers will refuse to make the change and
will tell you that you should change all filenames from .HTM to .HTML,
perhaps using a special script that they provide.
In this case, it will be necessary to reprocess and re-upload your data,
so that all the internal links in each of the datafiles say .html instead
of .htm.  Under the Windows 3.1 version of GED2HTML, this can be done by
putting the following in the "Additional Options:" field in the top-level
dialog box:
<LISTING>
	-D FILENAME_TEMPLATE="%s.html"
</LISTING>
You may also need to adjust the "Case-fold-links" option, depending
on whether the files are coming out on your Web provider with upper-case
names or lower-case names.
After processing your GEDCOM with FILENAME_TEMPLATE option, archive the
output files, upload them to your Web provider, and unpack them,
as described above.  At this point, you will have a bunch of files ending
in .HTM, but the within the files will be ".HTML", so it will be necessary
to systematically rename all of your files.
If your provider provides a script to change .HTM to .HTML,
use it.  If not, then on a Unix-based provider you can use the
following shell script.  Enter it into a file ``renameall.csh''
on the provider's system exactly as shown.
<LISTING>
	foreach f ( HTML/*.HTM )
	mv $f $f:s/.HTM/.HTML/
	end
	foreach d ( HTML/D0* HTML/INDEX HTML/SURNAMES HTML/SOURCES HTML/NOTES )
	foreach f ( $d/*.HTM )
	mv $f $f:s/.HTM/.HTML/
	end
	end
</LISTING>
Put it into the directory on the provider's system that contains
the "html" subdirectory created when you unpacked your uploaded
data.  From that directory, type
<LISTING>
	csh renameall.csh
</LISTING>
If the above command succeeds, you should be ready to go!
If the command fails for some reason, you'll have to enlist the help
of someone who is familiar with Unix systems, as it is not possible
for me to anticipate and explain here all the possible failure
modes and ways to recover. <P>

I have also been told about a utility called "MultiRen", which
is a Multiple File Rename utility.  A GED2HTML user writes:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
I discovered a neat Multiple File Rename utility, MultiRen, a great idea
for those of us that use your GED2HTML for generating multiple
databases, so we can give the g0000... and ind00... files different
names (g12xx and ind12xx for instance) for each database.  [I've been
doing this by hand, and editing the html with a global find & replace
utility]

Customizing GED2HTML Output under Windows
</A>
</H2>

The output produced by GED2HTML is extensively customizable to suit
the tastes of individual users.  There are two main ways to customize
the output: (1) by selecting various options settings from the GED2HTML
dialog box; (2) by modifying or rewriting the output program
that controls the generation of the HTML output.
Most people will probably find the amount of customization that
can be performed via the dialog box options to be adequate for their needs.
I discuss the mechanics of making these customizations below.
Modifying the output program is more involved, and is discussed
<A HREF="#templates.html">here</A>. <P>

When GED2HTML is launched, the dialog box that appears contains
blanks for "GEDCOM File" and "Options File".
There is a button group entitled "Option Editing", containing buttons
"Load", "Edit", and "Save".
Finally, there is a field entitled "Additional Options", and a
field entitled "Options Summary".  (The latter field is read-only.)
To cause the program to do anything interesting at all, you at least
have to enter the name of the GEDCOM File to be processed in the
"GEDCOM File" field.  The other fields and buttons are used to
load, edit and save options sets that control how your GEDCOM is
processed.  When you are satisfied with the options set you have selected,
click on "OK" to initiate processing of your GEDCOM.  <P>

To preload an options set saved in a previous run of GED2HTML,
enter the name of the saved options set in the "Options File" field,
and then click on "Load".  The previously saved options will be read
in and used to initialize the various fields of the dialog box.
To save the currently selected options, click on "Save".
You will be prompted with a "Save As" box for selecting the name
of the file to which to save the options set. <P>

To make changes to the current options set, click on "Edit".
This will bring up a second dialog box containing several more fields,
entitled "Output Program", "Mail-to address", "Home page URL", and
"Target Directory".  These are used as described below.
When you are satsfied with the options you have selected, click on
"OK" to return to the top-level dialog box.  Clicking on "Cancel"
returns you to the top-level dialog box after abandoning any changes
you have made. <P>

The customizable fields appearing in the dialog box are listed and
explained below.  Note that there are many other options you can select
that do not have their own fields in the dialog box.  Those options
are selected using the "Additional Options" field, as described
<A HREF="#additional_options">here</A>.
<DL>
<DT> <B>Output Program:</B>
<DD> This field is used to enter the name of an output program
	to substitute for the built-in program.  For more on output
	programming, see <A HREF="#templates.html">here</A>. <P>
<DT> <B>Mail-to address:</B>
<DD> If desired, enter your E-mail address in this field.
	GED2HTML will automatically place a "mailto" link at the bottom
	of the "top-level" persons and surnames index pages,
	to enable people viewing your pages to
	send you E-mail in a convenient way.
	It is highly recommended that you use this option, because
	I get lots of E-mail from people who are looking at GED2HTML
	pages created without "mailto" links, and who would like
	to contact the creator of the page with valuable additional
	information or corrections, but can't figure out how to do it.
        <P>
<DT> <B>Home page URL:</B>
<DD> If desired, enter the URL of your main "Welcome" page here.
	GED2HTML will automatically place a "home" link at the bottom
	of each page of output, to enable people viewing your pages
	to navigate back to your home page.
	Use of this option is also highly recommended, because many
	people aren't familiar enough with the Web to figure out how
	to find a "home" page unless they have a specific link to it.
	<P>
<DT> <B>Target Directory:</B>
<DD> By default, GED2HTML places its output in a subdirectory "HTML"
	of the directory from which it is launched.  If you wish it to
	place its output somewhere else, put the name of that directory
	in this field.
	GED2HTML will attempt to create this directory if it doesn't
	already exist.
</DL> <P>

From the second-level dialog box, clicking on "More Options" will bring
up yet another dialog box with lots of blanks and buttons.
Below a brief description is given of each.
After you are satisfied with the options you have selected,
click on "OK" to return to the previous dialog box.
Clicking on "CANCEL" returns you to the previous dialog box after
abandoning any changes you made.
<DL>
<DT> <B>Individuals per file:</B>
<DD> A number entered in this box determines the number of individuals
	GED2HTML will try to put in each of the individual data files
	it creates.  Putting several individuals in a single file tends
	to save disk space on many systems.  The default value is 10.
	To force GED2HTML to put exactly one individual per file,
	enter 0 in this field. <P>

	NOTE: If "Stable filenames" is selected (the default), then GED2HTML
	treats a positive value entered for "Individuals per file" as a
	suggested target value.  It does not necessarily guarantee to put
	exactly the specified number of individuals in each file.
	If you must have exactly the specified number of individuals in each
	file, then turn off "Stable filenames".
	To understand more about how GED2HTML organizes information into
	various files, see <A HREF="#output.html">here</A>. <P>
<DT> <B>Files per directory:</B>
<DD> A number entered in this box determines the number of individual
	data files GED2HTML will put in a single subdirectory.
	The default value is 100.
	If 0 is entered in this box, then GED2HTML will not use any
	subdirectories.  Instead, it will create a "flat" structure in
	which all output files reside in the same directory. <P>

	CAUTION: Accessing directories with thousands of files in them
	is very slow under Windows, and especially under Windows 3.1.
	You are better off using subdirectories if at all possible. <P>
<DT> <B>Number of directories:</B>
<DD> A number entered in this box forces GED2HTML to use a fixed number
	of subdirectories to contain the individual data files.
	The default value is 0, which permits GED2HTML to use as many
	directories as it sees fit.
	Note that a nonzero value entered in this box causes any value
	entered in "Individuals per file" to be ignored, and GED2HTML
	will put as many individuals as necessary in each file in order
	to output all the individuals using the specified number of
	directories and files per directory. <P>
<DT> <B>Sources per file:</B>
<DD> For GEDCOMs containing many source records, putting all the sources
	in a single HTML file can produce a file that is too large to
	be downloaded conveniently over the Web.  Entering a nonzero
	value in this field causes GED2HTML to output sources to multiple
	files, with the total number of sources output in any one file
	limited to the specified value.  The default value is 0, which
	means put all sources in a single sources file. <P>
<DT> <B>Notes per file:</B>
<DD> For GEDCOMs containing many notes records, putting all the notes
	in a single HTML file can produce a file that is too large to
	be downloaded conveniently over the Web.  Entering a nonzero
	value in this field causes GED2HTML to output notes to multiple
	files, with the total number of notes output in any one file
	limited to the specified value.  The default value is 0, which
	means put all notes in a single notes file. <P>
<DT> <B>Pedigree depth:</B>
<DD> The value entered in this field controls the number of generations
	of ancestors that appear in the pedigree charts output in each
	individual data page.  The default value is 2.
	Entering a value of 0 turns off the production of pedigree charts. <P>
<DT> <B>Indiv. index width:</B>
<DD> The value entered in this field controls the maximum number of entries
	in each page of the hierarchical persons index.  The default
	value is 28, which means that each index page will contain
	links either up to 28 individual data pages, or up to 28
	"lower-level" index pages.  In general, the more entries per page,
	the fewer "levels" of index are necessary to index a given
	number of individuals.
	Entering 0 in this field turns off the hierarchical index feature,
	causing a "flat" index to be created in which all individuals
	appear in a single index page. <P>

	Note that GED2HTML does not always put the maximum number of
	individuals in an index page.  Rather, it tries to adjust the
	number of individuals in an index page to avoid producing lots
	of "widow" pages that contain very few entries.  It generally
	succeeds at this, except that it is sometimes the case that
	the top-level index page has only two entries in it.
	If it occurs, this situation can generally be avoided by increasing
	the index width somewhat. <P>
<DT> <B>Surname index width:</B>
<DD> For large GEDCOMs, putting all the surnames in a single surnames
	file can produce a file that is too large to download conveniently
	over the Web.  Entering a nonzero value in this field causes
	GED2HTML to create a multiple-file surname index, in which the
	number of surnames in any given file is limited to the specified
	value.  The default value is 0, which causes GED2HTML to put
	all the surnames in a single file. <P>
<DT> <B>Language:</B>
<DD> The string entered in this field selects the (human) language that
	will be used to produce various components of the HTML output.
	For example, if "English" is entered in this field, or it
	is left blank, then the output will be in English.
	If, instead "French" is entered in this field, then the output
	will be in French.
	The currently available choices are "English", "French",
	"Danish", "Dutch", "German",  "Italian", "Norwegian", "Swedish",
	"Finnish", "Slovenian", "Portuguese", and "Afrikaans".	<P>
	For further information on the effect of changing the output
	language, see <A HREF="#language.html#language">here</A>.  <P>
<DT> <B>Case fold links:</B>
<DD> This group of three radio buttons selects certain processing
	to be performed on the URLs output in HTML anchors (hyper-links).
	If "Lower" is checked, then all URLs output by GED2HTML as
	part of HTML anchors are converted (folded) to lower case
	before being output.  If "Upper" is checked, then all URLs are
	converted to upper case.  If "None" is checked, then no
	conversion of any kind is performed.  The default is "None".  <P>

	The reason for this feature is to accomodate the ideosyncrasies
	of various systems and uploading software having to do what happens
	to MS-DOS-style upper-case-only filenames when the files are
	uploaded from a Windows system to a Web service provider's system.
	If your uploading software seems to create all files on the
	provider's system with lower-case names, then select "Lower",
	to make the hyper-links work properly once the files have been
	uploaded.  If your uploading software creates all files on the
	provider's system with upper-case names, then select "Upper" instead.
	If you are using case-sensitive uploading software to upload
	from Windows 95 to a Unix or Windows 95 provider with a case-sensitive
	Web server, then "None" is probably the correct option to choose. <P>

        See <A HREF="#uploading.html#lowercase">here</A> for additional
	discussion of the upper-case/lower-case issue. <P>
<DT> <B>Upper-case surnames:</B>
<DD> Checking this box causes all surnames to be converted into upper case
	as the GEDCOM is read.  The default is checked.<P>
<DT> <B>Output individuals:</B>
<DD> Checking this box enables the creation of the data pages for individuals.
	The default is checked.	<P>
<DT> <B>Output index:</B>
<DD> Checking this box enables the creation of the persons and surnames
	indexes.  The default is checked.<P>
<DT> <B>Output GENDEX:</B>
<DD> Checking this box enables the creation of the "gendex.txt" index file,
	which can be used by the
	<A HREF="http://www.gendex.com/gendex/"><EM>GENDEX</EM></A>
	genealogical index to centrally index your data so that others
	can find it more easily.  The default is checked. <P>
<DT> <B>Omit sources:</B>
<DD> Checking this box causes the program to completely ignore any source
	information present in the input GEDCOM.
	The default is unchecked.
	Note that this option is different than the "Produce sources"
	option that was present in previous versions of the program.
	The previous option could be used to suppress production of a
	separate sources file, but links to the missing sources would
	still appear in the data pages.
	The new "Omit sources" option causes the program to completely
	ignore source information right from the start, so that no
	sources appear in the output, and there are no dangling links.
	<P>
<DT> <B>Omit notes:</B>
<DD> Checking this box causes the program to ignore any notes information
	present in the input GEDCOM (other than special notes used to flag
	living individuals, see <A HREF="#eliding.html">here</A>).
	The default is unchecked.
	Note that this option is different than the "Produce notes"
	option that was present in previous versions of the program.
	The previous option could be used to suppress production of a
	separate notes file, but links to the missing notes would
	still appear in the data pages.
	The new "Omit notes" option causes the program to completely
	ignore notes information right from the start, so that no
	notes appear in the output, and there are no dangling links.
	<P>
<DT> <B>CONT means break:</B>
<DD> If this box is checked, then notes records in the GEDCOM that
	are continued over several GEDCOM lines using the CONT tag
	will be rendered in the HTML output with a line break
	&lt;BR&gt; before each CONT line.  Continuation lines that
	use the CONC tag are rendered without a line break.
	This seems to correspond to the spirit of what the GEDCOM
	standard has to say about the use of CONT and CONC,
	however the output of some genealogy programs looks ugly
	this way.  In such cases, unchecking this box makes
	CONT be rendered exactly like CONC; that is, without a
	line break.  The default is checked.<P>
<DT> <B>Stable filenames:</B>
<DD> Checking this box enables a feature that causes GED2HTML to
	use a "hash function" to calculate the directory and file
	in which the data for a given individual will appear,
	directly from the GEDCOM identifier for that individual.
	This has the advantage of making the mapping from individuals
	to directory/file pairs "stable" under additions to and
	deletions from the GEDCOM.  This means that if you process
	your GEDCOM once, then add some new individuals to it and
	process your GEDCOM again, the second time all the individuals
	that were there the previous time end up in the exact same
	place in the output file as they did the first time.
	This feature can be advantageous for linking from external
	documents into the HTML tree output by GED2HTML.
	See <A HREF="#linking.html">here</A> for more details.
	The default is to use this feature. <P>

	The disadvantages of checking "Stable filenames" are:
	(1) GED2HTML has less control over exactly how many individuals
	will end up in any given file; (2) the hash function randomizes
	the individuals so that a particular file will generally contain
	a number of completely unrelated individuals, rather than a group
	of individuals with the same surname.  <P>

The "Additional Options" field is used to supply additional options
for which there are no fields or buttons in the dialog boxes.
Entering
<LISTING>
	-t FILE.EXT
</LISTING>
in the Additional Options field overrides all other options, and causes
GED2HTML to dump a copy of its built-in output program to the
file FILE.EXT.  You can use this to get a sample copy of the built-in
output program as a starting point for customizations. <P>

The other type of thing you can put in the "Additional Options" field
are initializations for variables for the output interpreter.
These initializations can be used to set existing options, or,
in combination with modifications to the output program,
to create new options.  To cause the output interpreter variable
"FOO" to be initialized with string value "BAR", you would put
<LISTING>
	-D FOO="BAR"
</LISTING>
in the "Additional Options" field.  To initialize "FOO" to the
integer value 3, you would use
<LISTING>
	-D FOO=3
</LISTING>
See <A HREF="#templates.html">here</A> for more details on
variables and the output interpreter.
For a list of all the output interpreter variables that can be
initialized to select processing options, see
<A HREF="#language.html#special">here</A>. <P>


<H3>
<A NAME="options_order">
Order of Options Processing
</A>
</H3>

As indicated above, GED2HTML has several different mechanisms for
selecting options that modify its behavior.  A summary of these
mechanisms, in the order in which they occur when GED2HTML is run
is the following:
<OL>
<LI>  When GED2HTML.EXE starts, predefined default values are set for
	  all the options.  <P>
<LI>  Options settings are made by the user in the GED2HTML.EXE dialog box.
	  These options can be saved by the user in a ".INI" file,
	  and loaded back into the dialog box during a later run.
	  Or, the ".INI" file can be edited directly if desired.<P>
<LI>  When the user clicks on "OK" in the GED2HTML.EXE dialog box
	  to initiate GEDCOM processing, any options that were changed
	  from the default values are output to the temporary file
	  G2HOPTS.TMP.  This file is used to communicate the changed
	  options to the G2H.EXE program, which then starts.<P>
<LI>  G2H.EXE reads options settings from the file G2HOPTS.TMP.<P>

Customizing GED2HTML Output under Unix
</TITLE>

<BODY>

<H2>
<A NAME="customizing_unix.html">
Customizing GED2HTML Output under Unix
</A>
</H2>

The output produced by GED2HTML is extensively customizable to suit
the tastes of individual users.  There are two main ways to customize
the output: (1) by selecting various options settings on the GED2HTML
command line; (2) by modifying or rewriting the output program that
controls the generation of the HTML output.
Most people will probably find the amount of customization that
can be performed via the command line options to be adequate for their needs.
We discuss the mechanics of making these customizations below.
Modifying the output programs is more involved, and is discussed
<A HREF="#templates.html">here</A>. <P>

GED2HTML understands command-line arguments according to the following
"Unix man page style" synopsis:
<LISTING>
	ged2html [-HvDft] [[--] &lt;gedcom-file&gt; ...]
</LISTING>
The various arguments have the following meanings:
<UL>
<LI> The -H argument causes GED2HTML to print a brief message listing
	the available arguments. <P>
<LI> The -v option causes GED2HTML to print out its version number
	and copyright information. <P>
<LI> The -D option takes a single argument, which has the form
	"VARIABLE=VALUE", where VARIABLE is the name of an output
	interpreter variable to be initialized, and VALUE is an
	integer or string value to which it is to be initialized.
	If the VALUE starts with a digit, then it is regarded
	as an integer, otherwise it is regarded as a string.
	If the VALUE starts with a double quote ("), then it is
	interpreted as a string.  In this case, the value must
	also end with a double quote, and the intervening characters
	are the characters in the string. <P>
<LI> The -f option takes a single argument, which is interpreted as
	the name of an options file.  The options template
	file must be in the format of an GED2HTML output program
	(see <A HREF="#templates.html">here</A> for more details)
	containing the definition of a single procedure, "set_options",
	whose purpose is to assign initial values to variables of the
	output interpreter that control GED2HTML processing.
	Any settings in the options file override defaults,
	but can themselves be overridden by initializations specified
	on the command line using the "-D" option, or by statements in
	the procedure "do_initialize" in the output program.
	<P>
	The following is a simple example of an options file.
	<LISTING>
	   define set_options
	   {
	      set LANGUAGE to "French"
	      set INDIVIDUALS_PER_FILE to 20
	   }
	</LISTING>
	<P>
<LI> The -t option takes a single argument.  If the argument is '-',
	then GED2HTML dumps the source code for its built-in output
	program to the standard output.  Otherwise, the argument
	is interpreted as a file name and the output program is dumped to
	that file.  This option is used for obtaining the exact source
	code to the built-in output program, so that it can be used as a
	starting point for customizations.
	See <A HREF="#templates.html">here</A> for information on
	output programs. <P>
</UL> <P>

Nearly all the processing options that can be selected in a GED2HTML run
are accessed by initializing certain variables of the output interpreter
to have certain values.  Initialization of output interpreter variables
can be accomplished in three different ways:
<OL>
<LI> By using the -D command line option to initialize the variables.
<LI> By using the -f command line option to select an options file.
	The "set_options" procedure in the options file
	is executed before any other processing occurs, for the purpose
	of initializing output interpreter variables.
<LI> By adding code to the procedure "do_initialize" in the output
	  program, to perform the desired initializations.
</OL>
<P>

For a list of all the output interpreter variables that can be
initialized to select processing options, see
<A HREF="#language.html#special">here</A>. <P>

As indicated above, GED2HTML has several different mechanisms for
selecting options that modify its behavior.  A summary of these
mechanisms, in the order in which they occur when GED2HTML is run
is the following:
<OL>
<LI>  When GED2HTML starts, predefined default values are set for

<LI>  If an options file has been specified using the "-f" command
	  line flag, then this file is read and compiled by the
	  GED2HTML output language compiler.  Then, the procedure
	  "set_options" in this file is executed by the GED2HTML
	  output language interpreter. <P>
<LI>  GED2HTML processes any additional options the user might
	  have specified using the "-D" command line flag.
	  Any such additional options settings override those
	  from steps (1) and (2). <P>
<LI>  If an assignment has been made to the OUTPUT_PROGRAM option
	  variable in step (2) or (3), then the specified output
	  program is located and compiled.  Otherwise, the built-in
	  standard output program is used. <P>
<LI>  GED2HTML executes the procedure <EM>do_initialize</EM> in the
	  output program.  Any options settings made in this procedure
	  will override those made in previous steps. <P>
<LI>  GED2HTML reads the GEDCOM file and produces output.<P>
</OL>

<TITLE>
Modifying the GED2HTML Output Program
</TITLE>

<BODY>

<H2>
<A NAME="templates.html">
Modifying the GED2HTML Output Program
</A>
</H2>

One of the features of GED2HTML is that output processing is completely
controlled by a user-specifiable program, called the ``output program.''
The output program is written in a simple programming language designed
for this purpose.  Versions 3.0 and later of GED2HTML feature a completely
new output language that is much easier to use than the horrible template
language in older GED2HTML versions.  With this new output language,
it is possible for mere mortals (including me) to write better and more
elaborate GED2HTML output programs.  The main disadvantage of the new
output language is that it is too flexible, and as a result the size of
the standard output program has now grown to over 3300 lines of code!
Unfortunately, this can make it somewhat difficult for non-programmers
to make substantial modifications to the output format.
If you not a programmer, and find the idea of making changes to the
output program too daunting, then my best suggestion is to try to be
happy with the standard output format, and take advantage of the
large number of options settings that are available without modifying
the output program. <P>

A copy of the standard GED2HTML output program is provided with the
GED2HTML distribution as file "standard.g2h".  This output program
was preloaded into GED2HTML when it was compiled, and it is the one
that is used unless you explicitly supply another.
If you are happy with the output produced by the default program,
there is no reason for you to change it.  Note that GED2HTML supports a
large number of <A HREF="#customizing.html">options</A> that can be used to
perform the most common customizations.  However, if you wish to modify
the format of the output files in some way that is not supported by
any of the options, you can customize the output program to your own taste,
and then specify that GED2HTML should use your program instead of the
built-in one.
<UL>
<LI>  Under Windows, this is accomplished by entering the name
	of the output program in the "Output Program" field of the
	second-level dialog box.  <P>
<LI>   Under Unix, you specify the name of the program file by
	using the "-D" command line argument to initialize the
	variable "OUTPUT_PROGRAM" to be the name of the file containing
	the output program.
	For example:
	<LISTING>
	ged2html -D OUTPUT_PROGRAM=myprog.g2h myged.ged
	</LISTING>
	specifies that "myprog.g2h" is to be substituted for the
	preloaded output program.  <P>
</UL>
<P>

If you want to create your own output program, go ahead.  You can't hurt
anything.  Use the standard output program as a starting point.
GED2HTML reads your output program when it starts and reports on errors
before attempting to process your GEDCOM.
This means that, unlike earlier versions, it is no longer
possible to "crash" GED2HTML by supplying an incorrect output program,
and consequently GED2HTML output programming is pretty much like programming
in a standard programming language.  
You can edit the output program using, <EM>e.g.</EM> the DOS "EDIT"
program or the "Wordpad" program supplied with Windows 95.
It is probably best not to use a word processor to edit the output program,
because word processors typically feel free to change all sorts of
things like spacing and special characters in the document being edited,
which will cause your edited program not to be accepted by GED2HTML.

The GED2HTML Output Language

<H2>
<A NAME="language.html">
The GED2HTML Output Language
</A>
</H2>

The output language in GED2HTML versions 3.0 and later is
a simple programming language that is similar in many respects to
the programming language supported by the Unix command shell.
The <CODE>print</CODE> statement is the basic method of creating
output.  Besides this, the language supports standard conditional
and iteration constructs, procedure definitions with parameters,
integer and string variables, and assignment statements.
These other constructs basically exist in order to make it possible
to specify the desired order of execution of <CODE>print</CODE> statements. <P>

<B>Warning!</B>
The description of the output language given below is a fairly brief
summary which is more or less in typical programming language manual style.
I expect it to be understandable to a programmer, if not by itself then
in conjunction with study of the standard output program, and possibly also
some experimentation with the language.  I have not made any sort of serious
attempt to make it understandable to a non-programmer, nor am I likely
to do so in the future. <P>

<H3><A NAME="variables">Variables, Types and Values</A></H3>

The GED2HTML output language supports variables that take on
typed values.  The types of values supported by the language are listed
below.  Roughly, they comprise basic values (integers and strings),
and values that correspond to various kinds of records and substructures
defined in the GEDCOM 5.5 specification, except that in a number of cases
I have attempted to "uniformize" these structures to simplify the
logic of the output program necessary for traversing them.

<LI> <A HREF="#text_values">Text values</A>.
</UL>
Values that correspond to GEDCOM records generally have various
<EM>attributes</EM> or component values, that can be selected.
These are described in more detail below. <P>

Each variable is either <EM>global</EM>, or else it is <EM>local</EM>
to a particular procedure.  Whether a variable is local as opposed to
global depends on whether the procedure currently being executed contains
a <B>local</B> declaration for that particular variable at the beginning
of the procedure.  The values of local variables persist only as long
as the activation of the procedure in which they were declared.
The value of a global variable persists either until GED2HTML exits,
or else a new value is assigned to that variable. <P>

Some global variables are <EM>special</EM>, in the sense that they are
connected to the internal processing of GED2HTML.  Certain special variables
have the property that reading their value returns certain information
about the current state of GED2HTML.  Other special variables have the
propery that assignments to them modifies certain parameters that control
the processing of GED2HTML.  Nearly all the GED2HTML processing options
can be set by assigning to one of these special variables.
For a list of all the special variables and their meanings,
see <A HREF="#special">here</A>. <P>

An attempt to access a variable that is not special and has never been
assigned a value will yield a particular default value,
usually corresponding to 0 or "false".
Except during the options initialization phases that occur before
GEDCOM processing starts, an attempt to assign a value to a global
variable that does not already exist will elicit a warning message
from the GED2HTML output interpreter.  Usually this situation would
occur if there was a missing <EM>local</EM> declaration for the
indicated variable. <P>

<H3><A NAME="syntax">Syntactic Elements</A></H3>

<H4>Definitions</H4>

A GED2HTML output program consists of a sequence of <EM>definitions</EM>
of procedures.  Each definition is of the form:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
	<B>define</B> &lt;identifier&gt; &lt;formals&gt; &lt;locals&gt;
		<B>{</B> &lt;statements&gt; <B>}</B>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
The &lt;identifier&gt; gives the name of the procedure being defined.
The &lt;formals&gt; is a space-separated list of identifiers that name
the formal parameters of the procedure.  The &lt;locals&gt; is a declaration
of the local variables of the procedure, and it has the following form:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
	<B>local</B> id1 id2 id3 ... idn
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<H4>Statements</H4>

The GED2HTML output language supports the following types of
<EM>statements</EM>:
<DL>
<DT> <EM>Empty statement:</EM>
<DD> A blank can appear whereever a statement is syntactically required.
	Executing the empty statement has no effect. <P>
<DT> <EM>Call statement:</EM>
<DD> A call statement has the form:
	<BLOCKQUOTE>
		&lt;identifier&gt; &lt;actuals&gt; <B>;</B>
	</BLOCKQUOTE>
	The &lt;identifer&gt; is the name of the procedure to be called.
	The &lt;actuals&gt; is a space-separated list of "atomic" expressions
	(any expression can be made into an atomic expression by enclosing
	it in parentheses).
	Executing a call statement causes the actual parameter expressions
	to be evaluated, and then the named procedure is invoked with
	the resulting values as the actual parameters. <P>
<DT> <EM>Print statement:</EM>
<DD> A print statement has the form:
	<BLOCKQUOTE>
	<B>print</B> &lt;expressions&gt; <B>;</B>
	</BLOCKQUOTE>
	or the form
	<BLOCKQUOTE>
	<B>print</B> &lt;expressions&gt; <B>,</B>
	</BLOCKQUOTE>
	The &lt;expressions&gt; are a space-separated list of "atomic"
	expressions
	(any expression can be made into an atomic expression by enclosing
	it in parentheses).
	To execute a print statement, the expressions are evaluated,
	and the resulting values are output into the currently active
	output file, without any intervening spaces in the output.
	In the first form of the print statement, which ends with
	a semicolon, a newline is printed after the values of all the
	expressions have been printed.
	In the second form, no newline is printed. <P>
<DT> <EM>Debug statement:</EM>
<DD> The debug statement is identical in form to the print statement.
	The only difference between the two is that the the debug statement
	uses the keyword <B>debug</B>, and output from
	the debug statement is printed on the console (standard error),
	instead of the the current output file, as is the case with
	the print statement. <P>
<DT> <EM>Assignment statement:</EM>
<DD> The assignment statement has the form:
	<BLOCKQUOTE>
	<B>set</B> &lt;identifier&gt; <B>to</B> &lt;expression&gt;
	</BLOCKQUOTE>
	Execution of an assignment statement proceeds by first evaluating
	the &lt;expression&gt;, and then assigning the resulting value
	to the variable &lt;identifier&gt;. <P>
<DT> <EM>Deftag statement:</EM>
<DD> The deftag statement has the form:
	<BLOCKQUOTE>
	<B>deftag</B> &lt;identifier&gt; &lt;expression&gt;
	</BLOCKQUOTE>
	where <CODE>&lt;id&gt;</CODE> is a GEDCOM 5.5 tag
	(such as <CODE>INDI</CODE> or <CODE>BIRT</CODE>)
	and <CODE>&lt;expr&gt;</CODE> is an expression that evaluates
	to a string.  The effect is that the default print name
	for the specified GEDCOM tag (such as "Individual" or
	"Birth") is replaced by the new string.  This construct
	can be used by the end user to customize the GEDCOM tag
	names that get printed out with events; for example, if the
	user does not agree with the particular default translation
	of the tag name in a particular language. <P>
<DT> <EM>If statement:</EM>
<DD> The if statement has one of the forms:
	<BLOCKQUOTE>
	<B>if</B> &lt;expression&gt; <B>then</B> &lt;statements&gt; <B>end</B>
	</BLOCKQUOTE>
	<BLOCKQUOTE>
	<B>if</B> &lt;expression&gt; <B>then</B> &lt;statements&gt;
		<B>else</B> &lt;statements&gt;<B>end</B>
	</BLOCKQUOTE>
	<BLOCKQUOTE>
	<B>if</B> &lt;expression&gt; <B>then</B> &lt;statements&gt;
		<BR>
		<B>elseif</B> &lt;expression&gt; <B>then</B> &lt;statements&gt;
		<BR>
		<B>elseif</B> &lt;expression&gt; <B>then</B> &lt;statements&gt;
		<BR>
		...
		<BR>
		<B>else</B> &lt;statements&gt; <B>end</B>
	</BLOCKQUOTE>
	An if statement is executed by first evaluating the &lt;expression&gt;
	and interpreting the result as either "true" or "false".
	How the result of evaluation is interpreted depends on the type
	of value produced.
	If the value is an integer value, then a value of 0 is interpreted
	as "false" and a nonzero value is interpreted as "true".
	If the value is a string value, then a null value, or an empty string,
	is interpreted as "false", and other values are interpreted as true.
	If the value is any other type of value, then a null value is
	interpreted as "false" and a non-null value is interpreted as "true".
	<P>
	The truth value of the initial expression is used to control
	which of the alternatives is executed, in the usual way. <P>
<DT> <EM>While statement:</EM>
<DD> The while statement has the form:
	<BLOCKQUOTE>
		<B>while</B> &lt;expression&gt; <B>do</B>
		&lt;statements&gt; <B>end</B>
	</BLOCKQUOTE>
	This statement is executed as follows: the &lt;expression&gt;
	and interpreting it as either "true" or "false" as in the
	case of the if statement.  If the expression evaluates to "true",
	the &lt;statements&gt; are executed and the whole process repeats.
	If the expression evaluates to "false", execution of the statement
	terminates. <P>
<DT> <EM>For statement:</EM>
<DD> The for statement has the form:
	<BLOCKQUOTE>
	<B>for</B> &lt;identifier&gt; <B>in</B> &lt;expression&gt;
	<B>do</B> &lt;statements&gt; <B>end</B>
	</BLOCKQUOTE>
	Execution proceeds as follows.  First, the &lt;expression&gt;
	is evaluated.  If the resulting value is null, then the

	assigned to the control variable &lt;identifier&gt; and
	the &lt;statements&gt; are executed.
	Upon completion, the qualifier "next" is applied to the

	The expression is evaluated.  The resulting value, which must
	be a string value, is interpreted as the name of a file.
	The file is opened, and its contents are inserted into the

<H4>Expressions</H4>

The GED2HTML output language supports the following kinds of expressions:
<DL>
<DT> <EM>Numerals:</EM>
<DD>  A numeral, standing by itself, is an expression, which evaluates to
	the integer represented by the numeral. <P>
<DT> <EM>Strings:</EM>
<DD>  A string constant, standing by itself, is an expression, which evaluates
	to the corresponding string value. <P>
<DT> <EM>Variables:</EM>
<DD>  A variable, standing by itself, is an expression.  Variables can
	be either simple variables, which are single identifiers, or
	can have a more elaborate structure, explained
	<A HREF="#variables">below</A>. <P>
<DT> <EM>Parenthesized expression:</EM>
<DD>  An expression enclosed in parentheses is also an expression.
	 Parentheses are used to indicate grouping in the usual way.<P>
<DT> <EM>Negated expression:</EM>
<DD>  An expression preceded by a minus sign is also an expression,
	which evaluates to the negative of the value to which the
	constituent expression evaluates. <P>
<DT> <EM>Not expression:</EM>
<DD>  An expression preceded by a tilde (~) is also an expression,
	which evaluates to a truth value which is the logical negation
	of the truth value to which the constituent expression evaluates. <P>
<DT>  <EM>Plus expression:</EM>
<DD>  If E1 and E2 are expressions, then E1 + E2 is also an expression.
	If E1 evaluates to integer value v1 and E2 evaluates to integer
	value v2, then E1 + E2 evaluates to the integer value v1 + v2,
	otherwise an error occurs. <P>
<DT>  <EM>Minus expression:</EM>
<DD>  If E1 and E2 are expressions, then E1 - E2 is also an expression.
	If E1 evaluates to integer value v1 and E2 evaluates to integer
	value v2, then E1 - E2 evaluates to the integer value v1 - v2,
	otherwise an error occurs. <P>
<DT> <EM>Times expression:</EM>
<DD>  If E1 and E2 are expressions, then E1 * E2 is also an expression.
	If E1 evaluates to integer value v1 and E2 evaluates to integer
	value v2, then E1 * E2 evaluates to the integer value v1 * v2,
	otherwise an error occurs. <P>
<DT> <EM>Quotient expression:</EM>
<DD>  If E1 and E2 are expressions, then E1 / E2 is also an expression.
	If E1 evaluates to integer value v1 and E2 evaluates to integer
	value v2, then E1 / E2 evaluates to the integer value v1 / v2,
	otherwise an error occurs. <P>
<DT> <EM>Remainder expression:</EM>
<DD>  If E1 and E2 are expressions, then E1 % E2 is also an expression.
	If E1 evaluates to integer value v1 and E2 evaluates to integer
	value v2, then E1 % E2 evaluates to the remainder of dividing
	v1 by v2, otherwise an error occurs. <P>
<DT> <EM>AND expression:</EM>
<DD>  If E1 and E2 are expressions, then E1 &amp; E2 is also an expression.
	If E1 evaluates to a truth value v1 and E2 evaluates to a truth
	value v2, then E1 &amp; E2 evaluates to the logical conjunction
	of v1 and V2, otherwise an error occurs. <P>
<DT> <EM>OR expression:</EM>
<DD>  If E1 and E2 are expressions, then E1 / E2 is also an expression.
	If E1 evaluates to a truth value v1 and E2 evaluates to a truth
	value v2, then E1 | E2 evaluates to the logical disjunction
	of v1 and V2, otherwise an error occurs. <P>
<DT> <EM>Concatenation expression:</EM>
<DD>  If E1 and E2 are expressions, then E1 ^ E2 is also an expression.
	If E1 evaluates to a string value v1 and E2 evaluates to a string
	value v2, then E1 ^ E2 evaluates to the string value which is
	the concatenation of v1 and v2, otherwise an error occurs. <P>
<DT> <EM>Equality test:</EM>
<DD>  If E1 and E2 are expressions, then E1 = E2 is also an expression,
	which evaluates to "true" if E1 and E2 evaluate to equal values,
	and to "false" if E1 and E2 evalute to unequal values. <P>
<DT> <EM>Comparison test:</EM>
<DD>  If E1 and E2 are expressions, then E1 &lt; E2, E1 &gt; E2,
	E1 &lt;= E2, and E1 &gt;= E2 are also expressions which
	which evaluates to "true" if the indicated relationship
	holds between the value of E1 and that of E2.  <P>
</DL>

<H4><A NAME="variables">Variables</A></H4>

The following kinds of variables are supported:
<DL>
<DT> <EM>Simple variables:</EM>
<DD>  An identifier, standing by itself, is a variable, which evaluates
	to the most recent value assigned to that variable.
	If no value has yet been assigned to the variable, an error occurs.
	<P>
<DT> <EM>Qualified variables:</EM>
<DD>  A qualified variable is a variable, followed by a dot (.),
	followed by a <EM>qualifier</EM>, which is an identifier.
	The qualifier serves to select a particular attribute or
	component of the current value of the variable to which it is attached.
	For example, if i is a simple variable whose current value is an
	individual, then
	<BLOCKQUOTE>
		i.mother
	</BLOCKQUOTE>
	is a qualified variable whose value is the individual who is the
	mother of the individual denoted by i.  Furthermore,
	<BLOCKQUOTE>
		i.mother.name
	</BLOCKQUOTE>
	evaluates to the name of the mother.
	Qualifier names are <EM>not</EM> sensitive to upper/lower-case
	distinctions.  Thus 
	<BLOCKQUOTE>
		i.mother
	</BLOCKQUOTE>
	and
	<BLOCKQUOTE>
		i.MOTHER
	</BLOCKQUOTE>
	mean the same thing.
	<P>

	Whether the application of a particular qualifier to a variable v
	is meaningful depends on the current value of v at the time the
	qualified variable is evaluated.  For a list of all the currently
	supported qualifiers together with the types of values to which
	they apply, see <A HREF="#qualifiers">here</A>. <P>
<DT> <EM>Subscripted variables:</EM>
<DD> A subscripted variable is a variable followed by an expression
	enclosed in square brackets.  Evaluation of a subscripted
	variable proceeds first by evaluating the subscript
	(the expression within the brackets).  If the subscript does not
	evaluate to an integer, then an error occurs.  Otherwise,
	the variable to which the subscript is attached is evaluated,
	and then the "next" qualifier is repeatedly applied to the resulting
	value a number of times equal to the value of the subscript
	expression. <P>

	As a simple example, the subscripted variable
	<BLOCKQUOTE>
		i[3]
	</BLOCKQUOTE>
	can be regarded as an abbreviation for the qualified variable
	<BLOCKQUOTE>
		i.next.next.next
	</BLOCKQUOTE>
</DL>


<H3><A NAME="entries">Entry Points</A></H3>

The output program is used by GED2HTML in the following way:
each time GED2HTML wants to initialize options or create a
particular output file, it begins executing the output program by
invoking a particular <EM>entry procedure</EM> corresponding to the
type of file that is to be created.
Output produced by print statements during the execution of that
entry procedure and any procedures that it calls, goes to the
particular file being created.  GED2HTML assumes that the following entry
procedures are defined in any output program program:
<DL>
<DT> <EM>do_initialize</EM>
<DD> This entry procedure is called just prior to processing the GEDCOM file.
	It can be used to initialize or modify the settings of options
	variables.  For a detailed description of how GED2HTML options
	processing works, see
	<A HREF="#customizing_windows.html#options_order">
	here
	</A>
	for the Windows version and
	<A HREF="#customizing_unix.html#options_order">
	here
	</A>
	for the Unix version.
	<P>
<DT> <EM>do_index</EM>
<DD> This entry procedure is called to create the contents of a single
	file in the index of persons.  The procedure takes a single
	argument, which is an index value corresponding to the first
	index entry to be output.  Subsequent entries to be output to
	the same file can be accessed by repeatedly applying the "next"
	qualifier, until a null value is obtained. <P>

	Each index entry can be either a <EM>leaf</EM> entry,
	which references a single individual, or a <EM>range</EM> entry,
	which references a range of individuals.  Whether the
	entry is a leaf entry or a range entry can be determined by
	applying the "children" qualifier to the index node.  If
	node is a leaf entry, then applying the "children" qualifier
	yields a null value, and if the node is a range entry, then
	apply the "children" qualifier yields a nonnull value.
	For a leaf entry, the referenced individual can be obtained
	by applying the "first" qualifier to the entry.
	For a range entry, the first and last individual in the specified
	range can be obtained by applying the "first" and "last" qualifiers,
	respectively, to the entry. <P>
<DT> <EM>do_surnames</EM>
<DD> This entry procedure is called to create the contents of a single
	file in the index of surnames.  The procedure takes a single
	argument, which is an index value corresponding to the first
	index entry to be output.  Subsequent entries to be output to
	the same file can be accessed by repeatedly applying the "next"
	qualifier, until a null value is obtained. <P>

	Each index entry can be either a <EM>leaf</EM> entry,
	which references a single surname, or a <EM>range</EM> entry,
	which references a range of surnames.  Whether the
	entry is a leaf entry or a range entry can be determined by
	applying the "children" qualifier to the index node.  If
	node is a leaf entry, then applying the "children" qualifier
	yields a null value, and if the node is a range entry, then
	apply the "children" qualifier yields a nonnull value.
	For a leaf entry, the referenced surname can be obtained
	by applying the "first" qualifier to the entry.
	For a range entry, the first and last surname in the specified
	range can be obtained by applying the "first" and "last" qualifiers,
	respectively, to the entry. <P>
<DT> <EM>do_individuals</EM>
<DD> This entry procedure is called to create the contents of an
	individual data file.  The procedure takes a single argument,
	which is the first individual for which information is to be
	output into the file.  Subsequent individuals to be output to
	the same file can be accessed in succession by repeatedly
	applying the "next" qualifier.  When application of
	the "next" qualifier results in a null value, the end of the
	list of individuals has been reached. <P>
<DT> <EM>do_families</EM>
<DD> This entry procedure is called to create the contents of a
	family data file.  The procedure takes a single argument,
	which is the first family for which information is to be
	output into the file.  Subsequent families to be output to
	the same file can be accessed in succession by repeatedly
	applying the "next" qualifier.  When application of
	the "next" qualifier results in a null value, the end of the
	list of families has been reached. <P>
<DT> <EM>do_sources</EM>
<DD> This entry procedure is called to create the contents of a
	sources file.  The procedure takes a single argument, which
	is the first source for which information is to be output into
	the file.  Subsequent sources to be output to the same file
	can be accessed in succession by repeatedly applying the "next"
	qualifier.  When application of the "next" qualifier results
	in a null value, the end of the list of sources has been reached. <P>
<DT> <EM>do_notes</EM>
<DD> This entry procedure is called to create the contents of a
	notes file.  The procedure takes a single argument, which
	is the first note for which information is to be output into
	the file.  Subsequent notes to be output to the same file
	can be accessed in succession by repeatedly applying the "next"
	qualifier.  When application of the "next" qualifier results
	in a null value, the end of the list of notes has been reached. <P>
<DT> <EM>do_gendex</EM>
<DD> This entry procedure is called to create the contents of a
	"gendex.txt" file.  The procedure takes a single argument, which
	is the first individual for which an index entry is to be output.
	Subsequent individuals can be accessed in succession by repeatedly
	applying the "next" qualifier.  When application of the "next"
	qualifier results in a null value, the end of the list of individuals
	has been reached. <P>

	As the "gendex.txt" file has to be in a particular format to
	be understandable by the
	<A HREF="http://www.gendex.com/gendex/"><EM>GENDEX</EM></A>
	index server, it is strongly suggested that you use the
	standard code for this procedure.<P>

<H3><A NAME="qualifiers">List of all Types and Associated Qualifiers</A></H3>

The following list gives all of the types of values supported by the
GED2HTML output interpreter, and the set of qualifiers that
it is meaningful to apply to each type of value.  For the most part,
applying a qualifier to a value corresponds to selecting a particular
substructure of a given structure, as described in the GEDCOM 5.5

<H3><A NAME="special">List of all Special Variables</A></H3>

The special variables understood by the GED2HTML output interpreter
can be divided into two classes: <EM>read-only</EM> variables, which
can be read to yield internal information about the state of GED2HTML,
and <EM>read/write</EM> variables, which can be assigned to change
various options settings of GED2HTML.  In addition, there are several
ordinary variables that are not really handled "specially" by the GED2HTML
output interpreter, but rather are referenced by the standard output
program to control some features that do not require special support from
the output interpreter.  <P>

Note that variables <EM>are</EM> sensitive to upper/lower-case distinctions.
<P>

<H4>Read-only Variables</H4>

<DL>
<DT> <EM>HEADER</EM>
<DD> Yields a header value representing the information gleaned from
	the HEAD record of the GEDCOM being processed. <P>
<DT> <EM>NUMBER_OF_FAMILIES</EM>
<DD> Yields an integer value representing the number of family
	records contained in the GEDCOM being processed. <P>
<DT> <EM>NUMBER_OF_SOURCES</EM>
<DD> Yields an integer value representing the number of (level 0)
        source records contained in the GEDCOM being processed. <P>
<DT> <EM>NUMBER_OF_NOTES</EM>
<DD> Yields an integer value representing the number of (level 0)
        note records contained in the GEDCOM being processed. <P>
<DT> <EM>OSTYPE</EM>
<DD> Yields a string value which describes the operating system that
        the executing version of GED2HTML was compiled for. <P>
<DT> <EM>PATH_TO_ROOT</EM>
<DD> Yields a string value which gives the path from the output
	file currently being generated to the "root" of the output
	tree being constructed by GED2HTML.  This variable can
	be used to construct relative URL's in the current output
	file that will work for any combination of output processing
	options. <P>
<DT> <EM>PERSONS_URL</EM>
<DD> This variable has a string value, which is a relative URL suitable
	for reaching the top-level index of persons.  The value of this
	variable is affected by the "CASE_FOLD_LINKS" option and the
	"FILENAME_TEMPLATE" option. <P>
<DT> <EM>SURNAMES_URL</EM>
<DD> This variable has a string value, which is a relative URL suitable
	for reaching the top-level index of surnames.  The value of this
	variable is affected by the "CASE_FOLD_LINKS" option and the
	"FILENAME_TEMPLATE" option. <P>
<DT> <EM>TODAY</EM>
<DD> Yields a string value representing the date of the run. <P>
<DT> <EM>VERSION</EM>
<DD> Yields a string value which describes the version of GED2HTML
	that is executing. <P>
</DL>


<H4>Read/Write Variables</H4>

<DL>
<DT> <EM>CASE_FOLD_LINKS</EM>
<DD> This variable controls certain processing to be performed on the
	URLs output in HTML anchors (hyper-links).
	If the value "Lower" is is assigned to this variable,
	then all URLs output by GED2HTML as part of HTML anchors are
	converted (folded) to lower case before being output.
	If the value "Upper" is assigned to this variable, then all URLs
	are converted to upper case.  If the value "None" is assigned,
	then no conversion of any kind is performed.  The default is "None".
	<P>

	The reason for this feature is to accomodate the ideosyncrasies
	of various systems and uploading software having to do what happens
	to MS-DOS-style upper-case-only filenames when the files are
	uploaded from a Windows system to a Web service provider's system.
	Generally speaking, "None" is the correct initialization for this
	variable on a Unix system. <P>
<DT> <EM>CHARACTER_SET</EM>
<DD> The string value assigned to this variable controls the way in which
	GED2HTML interprets characters in the GEDCOM file.
	The possible values are:
	"ASCII", "ANSI", "ANSEL", "IBM WINDOWS", "MS-DOS", and "IBMPC".
        If no explicit assignment is made to this variable, then
	it gets initialized from the CHAR field of the GEDCOM header
	when the GEDCOM is read.
	If this variable receives an explicit assignment, then the
	value in the GEDCOM header is ignored.
  	The default is ANSI (ISO-Latin-1), in case the
	character set cannot otherwise be determined.  <P>
<DT> <EM>DESTINATION_DIRECTORY</EM>
<DD> A string value assigned to this variable is interpreted as the
	name of a directory in which the HTML files output by GED2HTML
	should be put. <P>
<DT> <EM>DOS_CODE_PAGE</EM>
<DD> Assigning an integer value to this variable selects the
	DOS code page to be used for GEDCOM's encoded using
	IBMPC or MS-DOS character sets, as determined by the CHAR
	field in the GEDCOM header.
	Currently supported code pages are 437 (United States),
	863 (Canadian-French), and 850 (Multilingual/Latin I).
	If an unrecognized value is assigned to this variable,
	the code page defaults to 850. <P>
<DT> <EM>ERROR_FILE</EM>
<DD> A string value assigned to this variable is interpreted as the
	name of a file to be used to log any errors that occur
	during the processing of the GEDCOM.  The default value
	is "g2herrs.txt". <P>
<DT> <EM>FILENAME_TEMPLATE</EM>
<DD> A string value assigned to this variable is interpreted as
	a pattern to be used in constructing the names of the various
	HTML output files.  The default is "%s.html", which indicates
	the name of an HTML output file is constructed by taking a
	base string and concatenating it with ".html". <P>
<DT> <EM>FILES_PER_DIRECTORY</EM>
<DD> A number assigned to this variable determines the number of individual
	data files GED2HTML will put in a single subdirectory.
	The default value is 100.
	If 0 is assigned to this variable, then GED2HTML will not use any
	subdirectories.  Instead, it will create a "flat" structure in
	which all output files reside in the same directory. <P>
<DT> <EM>GENERATE_INDEX</EM>
<DD> Assigning a nonzero value to this variable enables the creation of the
	persons and surnames indexes.  The default value is 1.<P>
<DT> <EM>GENERATE_INDIVIDUALS</EM>
<DD> Assigning a nonzero value to this variable enables the creation of the
	data pages for individuals.  The default value is 1.<P>
<DT> <EM>GENERATE_SOURCES</EM>
<DD> Assigning a nonzero value to this variable enables the creation of the
	sources files.  The default value is 1.<P>
<DT> <EM>GENERATE_NOTES</EM>
<DD> Assigning a nonzero value to this variable enables the creation of the
	notes files.  The default value is 1.<P>
<DT> <EM>GENERATE_GENDEX</EM>
<DD> Assigning a nonzero value to this variable enables the creation
	"GENDEX.txt" index file, which can be used by the
	<A HREF="http://www.gendex.com/gendex/">GENDEX</A> genealogical
	index to centrally index your data so that others can find it
	more easily.  The default value is 1.<P>
<DT> <EM>IGNORE_NOTES</EM>
<DD> Assigning a non-zero value to this variable will cause the the program
	to completely ignore any notes in the input GEDCOM,
	other than <CODE>!LIVING</CODE> notes.
	The default value is zero. <P>
<DT> <EM>IGNORE_SOURCES</EM>
<DD> Assigning a non-zero value to this variable will cause the the program
	to completely ignore any sources in the input GEDCOM.
	The default value is zero. <P>
<DT> <EM>INCLUDE_IMAGE_EXT</EM>
<DD>  The value assigned to this variable is a string that is automatically
	appended by the standard output program to the GEDCOM identifier
	(RIN) for an individual, to construct the name of an associated
	external file to be included in the HTML output.
	This file is inserted near the beginning of an individual page,
	and it is intended to be used to include an image of that
	person.  The default value is <CODE>.img</CODE>.  <P>
<DT> <EM>INCLUDE_INFO_EXT</EM>
<DD>  The value assigned to this variable is a string that is automatically
	appended by the standard output program to the GEDCOM identifier
	(RIN) for an individual, to construct the name of an associated
	external file to be included in the HTML output.
	This file is inserted near the end of an individual page,
	and it is intended to be used to include additional information
	about the person, external to the GEDCOM file being processed.
	The default value is <CODE>.inc</CODE>.  <P>
<DT> <EM>INCLUDE_PATH</EM>
<DD>  The value assigned to this variable is a string that is
	automatically prepended by the standard output program
	to the GEDCOM identifier (RIN) for an individual,
	to construct the name of an associated external file to be
	included in the HTML output.
	It is intended that this variable be used to specify the
	name of a directory in which the files to be included can
	be found.
	The default value is the empty string, which means that the
	files to be included will be taken from the directory in which
	the current output file is being produced.  <P>
<DT> <EM>INDEX_WIDTH</EM>
<DD> The value assigned to this variable controls the maximum number of entries
	in each page of the hierarchical persons index.  The default
	value is 28, which means that each index page will contain
	links either up to 28 individual data pages, or up to 28
	"lower-level" index pages.  In general, the more entries per page,
	the fewer "levels" of index are necessary to index a given
	number of individuals.
	Assigning 0 to this variable turns off the hierarchical index feature,
	causing a "flat" index to be created in which all individuals
	appear in a single index page. <P>

	Note that GED2HTML does not always put the maximum number of
	individuals in an index page.  Rather, it tries to adjust the
	number of individuals in an index page to avoid producing lots
	of "widow" pages that contain very few entries.  It generally
	succeeds at this, except that it is sometimes the case that
	the top-level index page has as few as two entries in it.
	This situation can generally be avoided by increasing the
	index width a bit. <P>
<DT> <EM>INDIVIDUALS_PER_FILE</EM>
<DD> Setting this variable to an integer value determines the number of
	individuals GED2HTML will try to put in each of the individual
	data files it creates.  Putting several individuals in a single
	file tends to save disk space on many systems.  The default value
	is 10.	To force GED2HTML to put exactly one individual per file,
	assign 0 to this variable. <P>

	NOTE: If "STABLE_FILENAMES" has a nonzero value (the default),
	then GED2HTML treats a positive value assigned to
	"INDIVIDUALS_PER_FILE" as a target value.
	It does not necessarily guarantee to put exactly
	the specified number of individuals in each file.  If you must
	have exactly the specified number of individuals in each file,
	then initialize "STABLE_FILENAMES" to zero.  <P>
<DT> <EM><A NAME="language">LANGUAGE</A></EM>
<DD> The string assigned to this variable selects the (human) language that
	will be used to render the names of various GEDCOM tags in the
	HTML output.  For example, if "English" is assigned to LANGUAGE
	then the GEDCOM tag "BIRT" will be rendered in the
	output as "Birth".  If, instead "French" is assigned to LANGUAGE,
	then the GEDCOM tag "BIRT" will be rendered as "Naissance".
	The currently available choices are "English", "French",
	"Danish", "Dutch", "German",  "Italian", "Norwegian", "Swedish",
	"Finnish", and "Slovenian".	<P>

	Setting the "LANGUAGE" variable actually has three distinct effects:
	<OL>
	<LI>  Various GEDCOM tags in the input file are rendered in the
	      HTML output according to the chosen language.
	      For example, if "English" is chosen, then the GEDCOM tag
	      "BIRT" will be rendered as "Birth".
	      On the other hand, if "French" is chosen, then this tag
	      will be rendered as "Naissance".
	      The specific translations of the GEDCOM tags are compiled
	      into GED2HTML and are currently not directly customizable
	      by the user.  This may change in a future version of GED2HTML.
	      <P>
        <LI>  The chosen language influences the choice of certain text
	      strings and punctuation in the HTML output.
	      The complete list of these strings can be found in the
	      GED2HTML output program, and can be customized by modifying
	      this program, as described <A HREF="#templates.html">here</A>.
	      <P>
        <LI>  When you enter a language name in the "Language" field,
	      GED2HTML also initializes the "LOCALE" variable to
              correspond to the chosen language.
	      The locale affects the translation and formatting of dates
	      that appear in the GED2HTML output, as well as the collating
              sequence and upper/lower case conversions for international
              characters.
	      The correspondence between languages and locales is
	      precompiled into GED2HTML.  However, if you find that
	      the preselected locale to be inappropriate, you can set
	      the locale independently by setting the <EM>LOCALE</EM>
	      output interpreter variable to the desired locale name.
	      NOTE: Locales are not supported by GED2HTML running under
	      Windows 3.1.
	      See <A HREF="#templates.html">here</A> for more details on
	      variables and the output interpreter. <P>

	      For a list of all the output interpreter variables that can be
	      initialized to select processing options, see
	      <A HREF="#language.html#special">here</A>.
	      <P>
	</OL>
	<P>
<DT> <EM>LIVING_CUTOFF_YEAR</EM>
<DD> This variable has an integer value.  If nonzero, then GED2HTML
	presumes that all individuals born or christened during this
	year or a later year are living unless they also have an
	explicitly recorded death or burial date, or unless
        the variable LIVING_IGNORE_DEATH has a nonzero value.
 	The default value is zero, which disables this feature.
	See <A HREF="#eliding.html">here</A> for more information on
	eliding information about living individuals. <P>
<DT> <EM>LIVING_IGNORE_DEATH</EM>
<DD> This variable has an integer value.  If nonzero, then GED2HTML
	does not automatically assume that a person is dead just
	because there is death or burial information.
	Setting this variable to a nonzero value, in combination
	with an appropriate setting of LIVING_CUTOFF_YEAR, can
	be used to suppress information about individuals born
	or christened since a particular date.
	The default value is one, which enables this feature.
	Setting the value of this variable to zero causes personal
	information to be output for persons born after LIVING_CUTOFF_YEAR,
	as long as there is some death or burial information for
	that person.
	See <A HREF="#eliding.html">here</A> for more information on
	eliding information about living individuals. <P>
<DT> <EM>LIVING_NOTE</EM>
<DD> This variable has a string value, which is inserted as an explanatory
	note on data pages for individuals that have automatically been
	presumed to be living.  Assigning to this variable changes the
	default text of the note.
	See <A HREF="#eliding.html">here</A> for more information on
	eliding information about living individuals. <P>
<DT> <EM>LOCALE</EM>
<DD> The string value of this variable controls the formatting of
	dates, as well as the collating sequence and details of upper/lower
	conversion for international characters.
	Normally this variable does not need to be set explicitly,
	as it is set automatically as a result of selecting a particular
	output language.  However, one can set this variable to override
	the default choice associated with the selected output language.
	The possible values are system dependent, and require that you
	have knowledge of the locales supported by your operating system.
	For additional related discussion, see
	<A HREF="#international.html#locale">here</A>.
        NOTE: Locales are not supported by GED2HTML running under
	Windows 3.1.
	<P>
<DT> <EM>NO_LDS_ORDINANCES</EM>
<DD> If set to a nonzero value, then the production of output corresponding
	to LDS ordinance information is suppressed.
	The default value is zero.  <P>
<DT> <EM>NOTES_PER_FILE</EM>
<DD> For GEDCOMs containing many notes records, putting all the notes
	in a single HTML file can produce a file that is too large to
	be downloaded conveniently over the Web.  Assigning a nonzero
	value to this variable causes GED2HTML to output notes to multiple
	files, with the total number of notes output in any one file
	limited to the specified value.  The default value is 0, which
	means put all notes in a single notes file. <P>
<DT> <EM>NUMBER_OF_DIRECTORIES</EM>
<DD> A nonzero number assigned to this variable forces GED2HTML to use a
	fixed number of subdirectories to contain the individual data files.
	The default value is 0, which permits GED2HTML to use as many
	directories as it sees fit.
	Note that a nonzero value assigned to this variable causes any value
	entered in "INDIVIDUALS_PER_FILE" to be ignored, and GED2HTML
	will put as many individuals as necessary in each file in order
	to output all the individuals using the specified number of
	directories and files per directory. <P>
<DT> <EM>OUTPUT_PROGRAM</EM>
<DD> A string value assigned to this variable is interpreted as the
	name of an alternate output program file, to be used
	to control the production of the HTML output files.
	See <A HREF="#templates.html">here</A> for more information on
	output programs. <P>
<DT> <EM>PEDIGREE_DATES</EM>
<DD> If this variable is assigned a nonzero value, then birth/death
	date information is placed in the pedigree charts output by the
	<CODE>pedigree</CODE> statement.
	The default value is 1, meaning that dates are produced.  <P>
<DT> <EM>PEDIGREE_DEPTH</EM>
<DD> The value assigned to this variable controls the number of generations
	of ancestors that appear in the pedigree charts output in each
	individual data page.  The default value is 2.
	Assigning a value of 0 turns off the production of pedigree charts. <P>
<DT> <EM>SOURCES_PER_FILE</EM>
<DD> For GEDCOMs containing many source records, putting all the sources
	in a single HTML file can produce a file that is too large to
	be downloaded conveniently over the Web.  Assigning a nonzero
	value to this variable causes GED2HTML to output sources to multiple
	files, with the total number of sources output in any one file
	limited to the specified value.  The default value is 0, which
	means put all sources in a single sources file. <P>
<DT> <EM>STABLE_FILENAMES</EM>
<DD> Assigning a nonzero value to this variable enables a feature that
	causes GED2HTML to use a "hash function" to calculate the directory
	and file in which the data for a given individual will appear,
	directly from the GEDCOM identifier (RIN) for that individual.
	This has the advantage of making the mapping from individuals
	to directory/file pairs "stable" under additions to and
	deletions from the GEDCOM.  This means that if you process
	your GEDCOM once, then add some new individuals to it and
	process your GEDCOM again, the second time all the individuals
	that were there the previous time end up in the exact same
	place in the output file as they did the first time.
	This feature can be advantageous for linking from external
	documents into the HTML tree output by GED2HTML.
	See <A HREF="#linking.html">here</A> for more details.
	The default value is 1. <P>

	The disadvantages of using "STABLE_FILENAMES" are:
	(1) GED2HTML has less control over exactly how many individuals
	will end up in any given file; (2) the hash function randomizes
	the individuals so that a particular file will generally contain
	a number of completely unrelated individuals, rather than a group
	of individuals with the same surname.  <P>
<DT> <EM>SURNAME_WIDTH</EM>
<DD> For large GEDCOMs, putting all the surnames in a single surnames
	file can produce a file that is too large to download conveniently
	over the Web.  Assigning a nonzero value to this variable causes
	GED2HTML to create a multiple-file surname index, in which the
	number of surnames in any given file is limited to the specified
	value.  The default value is 0, which causes GED2HTML to put
	all the surnames in a single file. <P>
<DT> <EM>UPPER_CASE_SURNAMES</EM>
<DD> Assigning a nonzero value to this variable causes all surnames to be
	converted into upper case as the GEDCOM is read.  The default
	value is 1.  For international characters, conversion into
        upper case depends on the current setting of the "LOCALE" variable.
        <P>
<DT> <EM>USE_LOCAL_TIME</EM>
<DD> If this integer variable has a nonzero value, then time-of-day
	information appearing in the output will be with respect to
	the local time zone, rather than GMT (UTC).
	The default value is zero. <P>
</DL>


<H4>Other Variables</H4>

Besides the above special variables, there are a few other variables
referenced by the default output program, which although not true
special variables in the sense that the GED2HTML output interpreter
has specialized support for them, nevertheless function as options flags
that modify the behavior of the standard output program. <P>
<DL>
<DT> <EM>BACKGROUND_COLOR</EM>
<DD> This variable has a string value, which is inserted on each
	page of output as the "BGCOLOR" attribute of the HTML
	"&lt;BODY&gt;" tag.  For example, setting this variable to
	"#ffffff" will set a white background. <P>
<DT> <EM>BACKGROUND_IMAGE</EM>
<DD> This variable has a string value, which is inserted on each
	page of output as the "BACKGROUND" attribute of the HTML
	"&lt;BODY&gt;" tag.  For example, setting this variable to
	"foo.gif" will cause the image file "foo.gif" to be used
	as the background image.
	In general, you typically would set this variable to be
	the full "absolute" URL of the location of the image file,
	for example <CODE>http://www.gendex.com/images/foo.gif</CODE>.
	If you don't do it this way, then you'll have to have a copy of
	"foo.gif" in every subdirectory created by GED2HTML,
	or else Web browsers will not always be able to locate the
	image file. <P>
<DT> <EM>CONT_MEANS_BREAK</EM>
<DD> If this variable has a nonzero value, then notes records in the GEDCOM
	that are continued over several GEDCOM lines using the CONT tag
	will be rendered in the HTML output with a line break
	&lt;BR&gt; before each CONT line.  Continuation lines that
	use the CONC tag are rendered without a line break.
	This seems to correspond to the spirit of what the GEDCOM
	standard has to say about the use of CONT and CONC,
	however the output of some genealogy programs looks ugly
	this way.  In such cases, assigning a value of zero to this
	variable CONT be rendered exactly like CONC; that is, without a
	line break.  The default value is 1. <P>
<DT> <EM>FAMILY_GROUPS</EM>
<DD> The integer value of this variable determines whether the
	output will be in the "traditional" GED2HTML individual-based
	format, or in a newer "family group sheet" format.
	The default is zero, which means the traditional format is used.
	<P>
<DT> <EM>HOMEPAGE</EM>
<DD> A string value assigned to this variable is interpreted as an
	URL, and a hyperlink to this URL is inserted into each of the
	output pages.  The purpose is to make it easy for people to get
	back to your home page, no matter where in your data
	they are looking. <P>
<DT> <EM>INLINE_NOTES</EM>
<DD> The integer value of this variable controls whether notes occuring
	at level 0 in the GEDCOM file will be placed on the same page as
	the individual or family that references them, or whether they
	will instead be placed in a separate notes files.
	The default value is zero, which means that the notes will
	be placed in a separate notes file.  <P>
<DT> <EM>INLINE_SOURCES</EM>
<DD> The integer value of this variable controls whether sources occuring
	at level 0 in the GEDCOM file will be placed on the same page as
	the individual or family that references them, or whether they
	will instead be placed in a separate sources files.
	The default value is zero, which means that the sources will
	be placed in a separate sources file.  <P>
<DT> <EM>LINK_COLOR</EM>
<DD> This variable has a string value, which is inserted on each
	page of output as the "LINK" attribute of the HTML
	"&lt;BODY&gt;" tag.  For example, setting this variable to
	"#00ff00" will cause hyperlinks to be rendered in green. <P>
<DT> <EM>MAILTO</EM>
<DD> A string value assigned to this variable is interpreted as an
	E-mail address, and an HTML "mailto:" link to this address is
	inserted into the "top-level" persons and surnames index pages.
	The purpose is to make it easy for people to contact you,
	no matter where in your data they are looking. <P>
<DT> <EM>NO_ALPHABET_TABS</EM>
<DD> The integer value of this variable controls whether or not
	an "alphabet tab" style surnames index will be produced.
	The default value is zero, which means that by default,
	the alphabet tab style will be used for the surnames index,
	as long as the special variable SURNAME_WIDTH is zero.
	If NO_ALPHABET_TABS is nonzero, or SURNAME_WIDTH is nonzero,
	then the "traditional" GED2HTML format will be used instead.  <P>
<DT> <EM>OMIT_META</EM>
<DD> The integer value of this variable controls whether or not
	HTML "META" tags will be inserted into the output pages.
	META tags supply various kinds of keywords and descriptive
	information that can help a browser display the document, and
	also can help Web indexing and search engines classify the
	document more appropriately.  The default value is 0,
	which means that META tags will be output.  <P>
<DT> <EM>TEXT_COLOR</EM>
<DD> This variable has a string value, which is inserted on each
	page of output as the "TEXT" attribute of the HTML
	"&lt;BODY&gt;" tag.  For example, setting this variable to
	"#ff0000" will make red the default text color. <P>
<DT> <EM>VISITED_COLOR</EM>
<DD> This variable has a string value, which is inserted on each
	page of output as the "VLINK" attribute of the HTML
	"&lt;BODY&gt;" tag.  For example, setting this variable to
	"#0000ff" will caused visited hyperlinks to be rendered in blue. <P>

<A NAME="ftmdates"><B>Q:</B></A>
<EM>
When I run the program, I get lots of error messages like the following:
<LISTING>
Date missing or uninterpretable ('BEF. 1998') at Gedcom line 89
</LISTING>
</EM> <P>
<B>A:</B>
These errors are produced because Family Tree Maker does not produce
GEDCOM files that are completely GEDCOM-5.5 compliant.  There should
not be any period after the keywords "BEF", "AFT", and "BET".
You can ignore the error messages, though this could affect GED2HTML's
ability to do
<A HREF="#eliding.html">automatic detection of living individuals</A>,
because it will not understand some of the dates in your GEDCOM.
As a workaround, you can edit the GEDCOM and remove the periods
before running GED2HTML.

<LISTING>
Missing/incorrect cross-reference ID in 'ALIA' at GEDCOM line 102
</LISTING>
</EM><P>
<B>A:</B>
These errors are produced because Family Tree Maker does not produce
GEDCOM files that are completely GEDCOM-5.5 compliant.
What should follow the ALIA tag is not a person's name, but rather
a cross reference such as @I123@.
This error is not very important, and probably doesn't even affect
the output of GED2HTML.  If you like, you can get rid of the error message
by editing the GEDCOM and changing all occurrences of "ALIA" to
"NOTE ALIA".

</EM> <P>
<B>A:</B>
Don't run G2H.EXE directly.  The proper way to launch GED2HTML is
to run GED2HTML.EXE, which will pop up a dialog box.
The program G2H.EXE gets called automatically from GED2HTML.EXE,
once the GEDCOM file and program options have been selected and
processing starts.

<A NAME="mimetypes"><B>Q:</B></A>
<EM>
Everything looks fine on my PC, but when I upload the
files to my Web service provider, all the HTML files have
suffix ``.htm'' and Netscape doesn't seem to interpret them
as HTML files.
</EM> <P>

<B>A:</B>
This is a somewhat technical problem.  The easiest solution
requires the cooperation of your Web service provider.
Web servers generally have a ``mime.types'' configuration file,
which lists mappings from filename suffixes to MIME types.
This information allows the server to determine what kind of
information is in a file by looking at the suffix.
The server communicates this information to your browser when
the file is retrieved, and the browser, in turn, uses the
information to control how the file is displayed.
Some servers lack an entry:
<LISTING>
	text/HTML	htm
</LISTING>
in this file, which would tell them that files ending in ``.htm''
are to be interpreted as HTML source.  Your files all end in
``.htm'' because they were created under DOS, and DOS only supports
three-letter filename suffixes.  It is not sufficient to change
the names of all the files to end in ``.html'', because then the
names won't match all the links in each of the files.
What you need to do is to ask your friendly Web service provider
to add the above entry to the server ``mime.types'' configuration
file.  Usually they will agree to do this for you, as it doesn't
have any bad effect, and it will generally help out DOS users
who are uploading HTML from their PC's.
If they refuse to make this change, you can work around it as described
<A HREF="#uploading.html#renaming">here</A>.
<P>
<HR>
<A NAME="longsuffixes"><B>Q:</B></A>
<EM>
Under Windows 3.1, how can I create all the output files so that their
names end in ``.html'', rather than ``.htm''.
</EM>
<P>

<B>A:</B>
You can't.  The reason is that DOS only supports three-letter filename
suffixes, and will truncate anything longer than that.
The Windows 95 version of the program does not have this limitation. <P>

<A NAME="changelinks"><B>Q:</B></A>

<B>A:</B>
You can do this by putting
<BLOCKQUOTE>
	-D FILENAME_TEMPLATE="%s.html"
</BLOCKQUOTE>
in the "Additional Options" field in the GED2HTML dialog box.

<A NAME="lowercase"><B>Q:</B></A>
<EM>
After I upload all the HTML files to my Web service provider,
none of the links work, because the file names are all in
upper case, but the links specify the file names in lower case.
</EM>
<P>

<B>A:</B>
Under Windows, reprocess your GEDCOM with the "Upper" radio button
selected in the "Case fold links" button group.
Under Unix, initialize the output interpreter variable
CASE_FOLD_LINKS to "Upper".  <P>

A similar procedure applies if the file names are all in lower case,
but the links specify the file names in upper case.
See <A HREF="#uploading.html#lowercase">here</A> for a more detailed
discussion of the upper-case/lower-case issue. <P>

<A NAME="includepath"><B>Q:</B></A>
<EM>
GED2HTML doesn't seem to find my "include files", which contain
HTML code to pull in images of each person in my database.  What's wrong?
</EM>
<P>

<B>A:</B>
GED2HTML looks for the include files in the <EM>destination</EM>
directory, which is typically called "HTML", and which is where the
output files and directories get produced.
This is admittedly somewhat counterintuitive, and it might be changed in
the future.  In the meantime, note that there is a mechanism
by which you can use a modified output program to change the directory
in which GED2HTML looks for the include files.
Specifically, you can change the line that reads:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
	include i.xref ^ ".img"
</BLOCKQUOTE>
to read instead:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
	include INCLUDE_DIR ^ i.xref ^ ".img"
</BLOCKQUOTE>
You will then need to put, for example:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
	-D INCLUDE_DIR="C:\MYDIR\"
</BLOCKQUOTE>
in the "Additional Options" field of the dialog box.
The effect of these two changes will be that GED2HTML will
look for your image files in the directory <CODE>C:\MYDIR\</CODE>,
instead of the destination directory.
<P>

<A NAME="escapes"><B>Q:</B></A>
<EM>
I wanted to change the background color on my HTML pages, and I tried to put
</EM>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
	print "&lt;BODY BGCOLOR="#66ccff"&gt;" ;
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<EM>
in the output program.  But GED2HTML didn't accept even this simple change.
</EM>
<P>

<B>A:</B>
First of all, you probably don't want to be doing this, because the standard
GED2HTML output program already has an option for setting the background
color.  Simply put:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
	-D BACKGROUND_COLOR="#66ccff"
</BLOCKQUOTE>
in the "Additional Options" field under Windows, or as an additional
command line argument under Unix.
This is one of a number of customizations that are controlled by setting
variables in the output interpreter.  For a complete list of all such
variables and the customizations they control, see
<A HREF="#language.html#special">here</A>.
<P>
If you really do think you want to edit the output program, note that
in the output language, it is necessary to escape double quotes
within string constants by using a preceding backslash.  Thus, the correct
change would be:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
	print "&lt;BODY BGCOLOR=\"#66ccff\"&gt;" ;
</BLOCKQUOTE>
The escapes are necessary, because otherwise there would be no way to
tell a quote that ends a string constant from a quote that is part of the
string to be printed.  The complete set of escapes understood within
string constants is documented
<A HREF="#language.html#stringconstants">here</A>.

<B>A:</B>
Put

	-D BACKGROUND_IMAGE="foo.gif"

You are trying to compile the program with a pre-ANSI C compiler.
It cannot understand ANSI function prototypes.

<A NAME="fgetln"><B>Q:</B></A>
<EM>
When I link the program under Unix, I get a message
``Undefined symbol _fgetln''.  What is wrong?
</EM> <P>

<B>A:</B>
You are running on an older or non-BSD version of Unix that does not
have the ``fgetln()'' function.
I actually wrote my own implementation of fgetln() and put it in the code,
but it is #ifdef'ed out because I would rather use a library version
if it exists.
Edit the Makefile and delete the ``-DHAVE_FGETLN'' from the
``CFLAGS'' line.  Then re-run ``make''.

<A NAME="strdup"><B>Q:</B></A>
<EM>

You are running on a version of Unix that does not have the ``strdup()''
function.  There is code for it, but it is #ifdef'ed out because I would
rather use a library version if it exists.
Edit the Makefile and delete the ``-DHAVE_STRDUP'' from the
``CFLAGS'' line.  Then re-run ``make''.

When compiling tags.c under Unix, the compiler complains about incompatible

</EM> <P>

<B>A:</B>
It may be necessary to place the cast <CODE>(struct tag *)</CODE> in front
of the call to <CODE>bsearch()</CODE> in tags.c, or possibly to change
the cast on the function argument
to bsearch to make the compiler happy.
This is not necessary with gcc, and it is my belief that it should not
be necessary under ANSI C.

</EM> <P>

<B>A:</B>
Some people have found that they need to #include &lt;unistd.h&gt;
in main.c.  My belief is that ANSI C dictates that the constant SEEK_END
should be in &lt;stdlib.h&gt;.  If you are having this problem,
try #include'ing &lt;unistd.h&gt; too.

<EM>
When compiling using gcc under SunOS 4.1.3, I get lots and lots of
compiler warnings, but the program compiles and runs.  Is this OK?
</EM> <P>

<B>A:</B>
Yes.  SunOS 4.1.3 does not have fully ANSI prototyped header files,
and you are compiling the program using the -Wall option, which causes
gcc to produce warnings for the slightest thing.  If you remove -Wall
from the <CODE>CFLAGS</CODE> line in the Makefile, the program will
compile quietly.

GED2HTML: Family Group Style Output
</A>
</H2>

Starting with GED2HTML v3.5, the family group style output that was
experimental in earlier releases has been fully integrated into the
standard output program.  Family group style output produces a
family group sheet page for each family, rather than the traditional
GED2HTML individual data pages.  Many people seem to prefer this style,
which looks more familiar to genealogists.<P>

Family group style output, is enabled by setting the output interpreter
variable FAMILY_GROUPS to a nonzero value.
Under Windows 95 and Windows 3.1 this is done by checking the
"Family Group Sheet" radio button under "Output Style" on the "More Options"
dialog screen.
Alternatively, put <CODE>-D FAMILY_GROUPS=1</CODE> either in the
"Additional Options" field of the dialog box under Windows 3.1 and Windows 95,
or else on the command line under Unix.
When family group style output is enabled, the number of family group
sheets that are put in a single output file is controlled by the
INDIVIDUALS_PER_FILE variable.

on customizing GED2HTML output.

International Characters and GED2HTML

<H2>
<A NAME="international.html">
International Characters and GED2HTML
</A>
</H2>

Starting with version 3.0, GED2HTML now includes some explicit support
for alternate character sets, including international characters.
The GEDCOM 5.5 specifications require the use of the ANSEL character set,
but in my experience many GEDCOMs are not actually encoded using this
character set.  More common are ASCII, ISO-Latin-1 (ISO-8859-1),
as well as IBM-PC encodings based on various DOS code pages,
which are in fact explicitly disallowed by the GEDCOM 5.5 specification! <P>

Internally, GED2HTML "supports" the ISO-Latin-1 character set.
What this really means is that, aside from possibly converting
ASCII characters with codes 127 or less from lower case to upper case,
the processing performed by GED2HTML simply treats characters in
the GEDCOM as 8-bit values to be passed through from input to output.
According to my reading of the
<A HREF="http://www.w3.org/hypertext/WWW/MarkUp/html-spec/html-spec_6.html#SEC6">
HTML specification</A>, a compliant ``user agent'' (<EM>e.g.</EM> a browser)
should accept HTML files encoded using this character set.
Netscape, for example, will read and display such characters properly.
If a browser ``barfs'' on characters with codes 128 and above, then it
is not an HTML-compliant browser. <P>

A number of people have complained that GED2HTML versions prior to
version 3.0 "didn't support international characters".
What this generally meant was that their GEDCOMs were encoded in
some IBM-PC character set, and when the 8-bit codes from their
GEDCOMs were passed through to the HTML output and interpreted by
an HTML-compliant browser, the characters that were displayed by the
browser did not appear the same as the ones they originally entered using
their genealogy program. <P>

To help with this problem, GED2HTML version 3.0 and later now applies the
following procedure which is intended to make more GEDCOMs produce output
that matches the user's expectations:
<OL>
<LI> When a GEDCOM is read, GED2HTML uses the information in the CHAR
	field of the HEAD record to attempt to determine the character
	set in which the GEDCOM is encoded.
	Currently, GED2HTML recognizes the tokens
	"ASCII", "ANSI", "ANSEL", "IBM WINDOWS", "MS-DOS",
	and "IBMPC".  The default is ANSI (ISO-Latin-1), in case the
	character set cannot otherwise be determined. <P>
<LI> As the GEDCOM is read in, GED2HTML attempts to translate it, from the
	character set in which it is encoded, to the "equivalent"
	encoding in ISO-Latin-1.  It is not always possible to do an
	exact job of this, because, for example, there are ANSEL
	sequences for which there is no ISO-Latin-1 equivalent.
	Anyway, it does the best it can, and I am open to suggestions
	for improvement. <P>
<LI> Once the data has been translated internally into ISO-Latin-1,
	no further change (other than possible lower/upper case conversions
	to characters with codes less than 128) is made to the data,
	before it is eventually emitted as HTML output. <P>
</OL>
If you find that GED2HTML is assuming the wrong character set for
your GEDCOM, you should override what the GEDCOM says by setting the
CHARACTER_SET output interpreter variable to the appropriate string.
NOTE: Brother's Keeper is known to lie about the character set
it has used to encode the GEDCOM, using
<BLOCKQUOTE>
	1 CHAR IBMPC
</BLOCKQUOTE>
when it really means
<BLOCKQUOTE>
	1 CHAR ANSI
</BLOCKQUOTE>
This is a typical circumstance in which you would need to override the
choice of character set.
This would be done, <EM>e.g.</EM>, by putting
<CODE>-D CHARACTER_SET=ANSI</CODE> in the "Additional Options"
field of the dialog box under Windows 3.1 and Windows 95, or
on the command line under Unix.
<P>

<H3><A NAME="locale">Locales</A></H3>
One problem I have had with the above scheme is figuring out a reasonable
way of doing lower/upper case conversions on characters with codes 128
and above.  A worse problem is obtaining the proper collating sequence
for sorting names into alphabetical order, because the proper ordering
can depend on the particular (human) language being used.
It now appears to me that the so-called "locale" support is maturing
under many operating systems, so starting in GED2HTML version 3.5,
I am relying on this support to perform the proper lower/upper case
conversions and comparison operations.  If you find that conversions
are not being done properly, you might be able to modify the default
behavior by explicitly setting the LOCALE output interpreter variable.
See <A HREF="#templates.html">here</A> for more details on variables and
the output interpreter.
If all else fails, the best advice I can offer is to turn off lower/upper
case conversion in surnames by setting the option variable
<CODE>UPPER_CASE_SURNAMES</CODE> to 0.  <P>

Some people seem to feel compelled to put HTML "entity codes" (e.g. &amp;ouml)
in their GEDCOM's.  My opinion on this is that these codes are HTML-specific,
and have no business being in a GEDCOM.  If I were trying to be really nice
to non-compliant HTML browsers, I would translate ISO-Latin-1 characters
in the range (128-255) to their HTML "entity codes" when creating the
HTML files.  I might still implement this, but it is not a high priority,
because in my opinion (supported by the HTML spec cited above) a browser
that cannot display these codes is broken. <P>

Linking from Other Documents into the GED2HTML Output Files
</TITLE>

<BODY>

<H2>
<A NAME="linking.html">
Linking from Other Documents into the GED2HTML Output Files
</A>
</H2>

GED2HTML can be used to prepare genealogical data to go along
with other HTML documents, such as a family history.  In doing this,
it is useful to be able to link from these other documents to the
individual data pages output by GED2HTML.  Let's see how this can
be done. <P>

When you run GED2HTML, it outputs a directory structure consisting
of a number of subdirectories (<CODE>D0001/</CODE>, <CODE>D0002/</CODE>,
<CODE>D0003/</CODE>, etc.) and files within subdirectories
(either <CODE>G0000001.html</CODE>, <CODE>G00000002.html</CODE>,
<CODE>G0000003.html</CODE>, etc.,
or else <CODE>I1.html</CODE>, <CODE>I2.html</CODE>, <CODE>I3.html</CODE>,
etc., depending on whether you have asked for multiple individuals to
be placed in a single output file).
For the purposes of discussion, let's suppose that the <CODE>Dxxxx/</CODE>
directories are all located under a single top-level directory
<CODE>HTML/</CODE> (this is the default under Windows). <P>

Now, suppose you wish to include the output of GED2HTML in a hypertext
book you are writing.  You might create a top-level directory
<CODE>BOOK/</CODE>, and with the <CODE>HTML/</CODE> directory a subdirectory.
The text of your book might be in files <CODE>chap1.html</CODE>,
<CODE>chap2.html</CODE>, <CODE>chap3.html</CODE>, etc. under a
<CODE>TEXT/</CODE> subdirectory of the <CODE>BOOK/</CODE> directory.
So, you would have the following directory and file structure:
<LISTING>
	BOOK/
	  TEXT/
	    chap1.html
	    chap2.html
	    chap3.html
	  HTML/
	    D0001/
	      G0000001.html
	      G0000002.html
	    D0002/
	      G0000003.html
	    D0003/
</LISTING> <P>

Suppose you want to put a link in the HTML file "chap1.html" that
links to individual "Joe Blow" with RIN "I151", whose HTML file output
by GED2HTML happens to be in file
<LISTING>
	BOOK/HTML/D0002/G0000003.HTM
</LISTING>
(You can find out exactly what file the individual data is in by using
a Web browser on the index to find the individual, and then recording
the URL you are viewing.)  To link to this individual, the best way to
do it is to use an anchor with a  "relative URL", which would appear as
follows:
<LISTING>
	&lt;A HREF="../HTML/D0002/G0000003.HTM#I151"&gt;Joe Blow&lt;/A&gt;
</LISTING>
The ".." means "go up to the parent directory", and the rest describes
how to go down into the particular file (<CODE>G0000003.HTM</CODE>)
that contains the individual with RIN I151.  The last "#I151" is a bookmark
that indicates where this individual's data is in the file "G0000003.HTM". <P>

The relative URL as above has the advantage that you can move the whole
<CODE>BOOK/</CODE> directory tree somewhere else on the system,
and you won't have to change any of the links.  However, if you change the
position of the file "chap1.html" relative to the <CODE>HTML/</CODE>
directory, you will have to change the URL to reflect the difference. <P>

Now, let's consider what happens if you add more data to your GEDCOM,
and you'd like to reprocess it for your book.  Ideally, you would just
re-run GED2HTML and replace the contents of the <CODE>HTML/</CODE>
directory by the output files from the new run.  This works, as long
as you don't change the number of individuals in your GEDCOM.
If you change the number of individuals between runs, then on the
second run, GED2HTML might decide to use a different number of directories
than it did on the first run.  This is because the default behavior of
GED2HTML is to figure out how many directories you need to hold all your
data, with the default number of files per directory and individuals per file.
If GED2HTML decides more directories are needed on the second run, then
after this run all the links in your book will point to the wrong places. <P>

Fortunately, there is a way around this difficulty.  GED2HTML includes
a "stable filenames" option in which the subdirectory and
file a particular individual should go in is calculated from the
individuals cross-reference ID using something technically known as a
"hash function".  If "stable filenames" are enabled, then as long as
the same number of subdirectories and files per subdirectory are being
used, the same individuals will end up in the same places, regardless
of what other individuals have been added to or deleted from the GEDCOM. <P>

By default, GED2HTML has a certain number of individuals that it tries to
put in each file.  It computes the required number of subdirectories
and files per subdirectory based on this parameter and the total number
of individuals in the GEDCOM.  However, if you change the number of
individuals in your GEDCOM and you wish to take advantage of the
stable filenames option, then you need to tell GED2HTML to use a specific
number of directories and a specific number of files per directory.
GED2HTML permits you do to this by specifying the appropriate
<A HREF="#customizing.html">processing options</A>. <P>

So, suppose the first time you run GED2HTML you use the default options,
which under Windows are 10 individuals per file, 100 files per subdirectory,
and as many subdirectories as are needed.  Suppose you ended up with
three subdirectories: <CODE>D0001/</CODE>, <CODE>D0002/</CODE>, and
<CODE>D0003/</CODE>.  You then add links from the text of your book into
the HTML pages in these subdirectories.  At a later date, after modifying
your GEDCOM, you decide you want to re-run GED2HTML on the new GEDCOM.
You should tell GED2HTML on this second run to use three subdirectories
and 100 files per subdirectory.  As a result, all individuals that were
present in the original GEDCOM will end up in the same files after the second
run as they did after the first. <P>

There are two disadvantages to the "stable filenames" feature, which
might make you want to disable it if you are not trying to link into
your database from external documents.   The first disadvantage is
that the assignment of individuals to files using stable filenames appears
random, so that individuals from the same family group will not likely
end up in the same file.  The second disadvantage is that using
stable filenames GED2HTML is not always able to do a very good job
at packing a uniform number of individuals in each file.
If you disable the stable filenames feature, then GED2HTML assigns
individuals to files in alphabetical order by surname, and it
always puts the maximum number of individuals in each file. <P>

Including HTML Code Inline

<BODY>

<H2>
<A NAME="inlining.html">
Including HTML Code Inline
</A>
</H2>

The standard output program compiled into GED2HTML provides for
inlining arbitrary HTML code at two standard positions in the page
for each individual.
The first place occurs just after the name of the individual,
and it is intended (though not required) that it be used to
insert an image of the individual.  When the program is run,
as it processes each individual, it looks for a file "xxxxx.img",
where "xxxxx" is the GEDCOM identifier (RIN)
(see <A HREF="#rin">below</A>) of the individual being
processed.
By default, the program looks for this file in the "destination
directory", which is the directory in which the HTML
output files and subdirectories are being created.
If found, the "xxxxx.img" file is inserted verbatim into
the output stream.  For this to be useful, you should put HTML code
in that file; for example, the file "xxxxx.img" might contain the code:
<LISTING>
	&lt;IMG SRC="daddy.gif"&gt;
</LISTING>
This code will end up getting inserted inline into the HTML output
for individual with ID "xxxxx".  The effect will be that when the
page for this individual is viewed, the image from the GIF file
<CODE>daddy.gif</CODE> will appear as part of the page. <P>

The second place where the standard template allows for arbitrary
inclusions is at the end of the information for each individual.
At this point, GED2HTML looks for a file "xxxxx.inc".  It is intended
(though again not required), that this file would include any additional
notes or information about this person not present in the original
GEDCOM file.  For example, I have used this in my hypertext family
history document to link to things like wills and divorce records. <P>

If you customize the output program, you can arrange for inlining
anything you want, using the same mechanism as is used by the default
program.  For more information on customizing the output program, see
<A HREF="#templates.html">here</A>. <P>

There are several option variables whose values affect the behavior of
the inlining feature.
The <CODE>INCLUDE_PATH</CODE> variable is a string that is
automatically prepended by the standard output program
to the GEDCOM identifier (RIN) for an individual,
to construct the name of an associated external file to be
included in the HTML output.
The default value is the empty string.
You might find it useful to set this variable to the full path name
of a directory in which you keep all the files to be included when
you process your GEDCOM.
The <CODE>INCLUDE_IMAGE_EXT</CODE> and
<CODE>INCLUDE_INFO_EXT</CODE> variables are strings that are
automatically appended by the standard output program to the GEDCOM
identifier when constructing the name of the file to be included.
The default values are <CODE>.img</CODE> and <CODE>.inc</CODE>,
respectively.
The <CODE>INCLUDE_IMAGE_EXT</CODE> variable is for the first include,
which is intended to be used to include an image of an individual.
The <CODE>INCLUDE_INFO_EXT</CODE> variable is for the second include,
which is intended to be used to include additional information
about an individual. <P>

<H3>
<A NAME="example">Example</A>
</H3>

Suppose you had a photo you wanted to include in the output
for the individual with GEDCOM identifier <CODE>I123</CODE>.
Create a directory somewhere on your system, into which you will
place the file to be included.  For example, you might create:
<LISTING>
        C:\Windows\Desktop\G2h-includes
</LISTING>
Next, create a file in the new directory with the name <CODE>I123.img</CODE>.
Use a text editor (like Notepad) to put the following text in this file:
<LISTING>
	&lt;IMG SRC="../images/daddy.gif"&gt;
</LISTING>
Then, run GED2HTML and put the following in the "Additional Options" field
of the dialog screen:
<LISTING>
        -D INCLUDE_PATH="C:\Windows\Desktop\G2h-includes"
</LISTING>
This will cause the <CODE>HTML</CODE> directory to be created as usual,
with all the individual data files in subdirectories.  Finally, create
a subdirectory <CODE>images</CODE> of the <CODE>HTML</CODE> directory
and put the image file <CODE>daddy.gif</CODE> there.  <P>

If all is well, when you view the files with your browser, the
image will appear near the beginning of the page for individual
<CODE>I123</CODE>.
If this doesn't happen, then you have to debug what went wrong.
This requires some familiarity with HTML and how browsers find documents
and images, and it is outside the scope of what I can explain here.
Please consult an HTML primer to get a better understanding of what
might have happened.  <P>

<H3>
<A NAME="rin">GEDCOM Identifiers (RINs)</A>
</H3>

<P>
Every individual in a GEDCOM file gets assigned an identifier that permits
cross references between one part of the GEDCOM and another.
These identifiers are sometimes called "RINs".  The exact format of the
string used for a RIN depends on the particular program that created
the GEDCOM, though many genealogy programs use an "I" followed by a
number, such as <CODE>I123</CODE>.
</P>

<P>
GED2HTML uses the RIN of an individual to construct names for external
files to be included in the HTML output for that individual.
To find out the RIN of an individual, you generally have to look in
the GEDCOM (use a text editor such as Notepad or Wordpad), and find
the defining record for that individual.  This will look something
like the following:
<LISTING>
        0 @I123@ INDI
        1 NAME Joe /BLOW/
        1 BIRT
        2 DATE 1 JAN 2000
</LISTING>
and so on.  The RIN is the string in between the <CODE>@@</CODE>.
Sometimes, genealogy programs (such as PAF) use the RINs as a means
for users to identifying individuals when entering data.
In this case, you won't have to look into the GEDCOM to find out
what the RIN for an individual is.
In other cases, a genealogy program will renumber the individuals
every time a GEDCOM is exported, so you'll have no choice but to
look in the GEDCOM and adjust the names of your include files
accordingly.

GED2HTML: Eliding Information about Living Individuals
</TITLE>

<H2>
<A NAME="eliding.html">
GED2HTML: Eliding Information about Living Individuals
</A>
</H2>

You may wish to arrange that information in your GEDCOM about living
individuals not appear in the HTML output.  There are two ways you
can accomplish this with GED2HTML: a manual method and an automatic method.
Under either of these methods, the standard output program
will suppress all information about a living individual except for
the name and an explanatory note.
If different behavior (more or less information) is desired for living
individuals, this can be achieved by modifying the output program. <P>

<H3>Manual Method</H3>

Either edit your GEDCOM directly using a text editor,
or use your favorite genealogy program to add a note of the following
form to the <CODE>0 INDI</CODE> records for each living individual:
<LISTING>
	1 NOTE !LIVING This individual is still living.
</LISTING>
The note has the form of an ordinary NOTE field, and the text following
the <CODE>!LIVING</CODE> is up to you to choose.  You may use
<CODE>CONT</CODE> or <CODE>CONC</CODE> to continue the line if you wish.
If you are using a genealogy program to enter the note, you should
skip the <CODE>1 NOTE</CODE> and begin with <CODE>!LIVING</CODE>. <P>

When GED2HTML sees a note of this form in the information about an
individual, it sets a special "living" flag for that individual.
The "living" flag can be accessed in the output program
by applying the qualifier "living" to the individual.
When the standard output program encounters an individual
for which the "living" flag is set, it outputs only the name of
the individual and the note that begins with the <CODE>!LIVING</CODE>
string.  No other information about the individual is output.
The name of the individual <EM>will</EM> appear in the
index of persons, but it will <EM>not</EM> appear in the
<CODE>GENDEX.txt</CODE> file. <P>

<H3>Automatic Method</H3>

If you don't want to manually flag each living individual in your GEDCOM,
you can ask GED2HTML to decide for itself whether an individual should
be regarded as living.  To enable this option, you should set the
option variable LIVING_CUTOFF_YEAR to an integer value; for example, 1900.
Under Windows, this would be done by putting
<LISTING>
	-D LIVING_CUTOFF_YEAR=1900
</LISTING>
in the "Additional Options" field of the GED2HTML dialog box.
Under Unix, you would add the above to the command line when invoking
GED2HTML. See <A HREF="#templates.html">here</A> for more details on
variables and the output interpreter. <P>

If you have set LIVING_CUTOFF_YEAR to a nonzero value, then each time
GED2HTML reads an individual from your GEDCOM file, it performs the following
steps:
<OL>
<LI>  If the individual has already been flagged as living,
	by the presence of a "!LIVING" note inserted manually,
	then nothing else special is done. <P>
<LI>  If the individual has either a birth or a christening date,
	and if the year of birth or christening is greater than or
	equal to the value of LIVING_CUTOFF_YEAR, then the individual
	is automatically flagged as living.  The living flag can be
	accessed from the output interpreter by applying the qualifier
	"living" to the individual, just as in the manual method.

If LIVING_CUTOFF_YEAR has been set, and an individual was born
or christened after the specified year, then the default behavior
of GED2HTML is to assume the individual is living and that information
about that individual should be suppressed.
The default is set this way because in some countries (France, for example),
is against the law to distribute information about persons born
too recently, whether or not they are already dead.
If you want the program to output information about recently born
individuals if they are known to be dead, then explicitly setting the
variable LIVING_IGNORE_DEATH to 0 (the default value is 1) will cause
GED2HTML to assume that an individual is dead if there is any
death or burial information for that individual.

From time to time people mail me and are either looking for GED2HTML
output code to do a certain thing, or else have written such code that
they want to share with others.  For this reason, I have created a
<A HREF="http://www.gendex.com/download/templates/">library</A> of contributed
GED2HTML output code.  Feel free to download whatever you want, but note
that I am not actively supporting this code, so use it at your own risk!
