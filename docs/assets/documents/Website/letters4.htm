        Maysville Ala, Nov 8th 1863</strong><p><strong>Dear
        Father<br>
        Your letter of the 25th ult. was received a few days ago
        and found me well able to eat my allowance. It is a
        sunshiny but rather windy day. I think I have rec&#146;d
        nearly all the letters sent me, have got 3 from
        Amelia[Amelia Potter, HAP&#146;s sister] and two from you
        lately. But a week ago yesterday<br>
        was the first mail received in over a month.</strong></p>
        <p><strong>I have written to Amelia two or 3 times. I
        heard by Lewis Wilcox[Lewis H Wilcox, Ovid Mich]
        wife&#146;s letter that John Gilbert[Ovid, Mich] had fell
        on sidewalk and hurt his leg again severely. I have recd
        a letter from John saying nothing about it. Is it so?</strong></p>
        <p><strong>I am sorry almost that our horses are gone but
        if you think it best all right, but I don&#146;t see how
        you can get along without them. If you would rather be at
        home I would stay there and not bother myself abut the
        debts. I had calculated to help along some of them
        myself, if we ever get our pay.<br>
        U.S. owes me now about $500 all clear. I owe nobody so
        you see I am going to help some - sometime &#150; well
        you can go without a little while. Money well buy as good
        as you sold I suppose.</strong></p>
        <p><strong>You talk of coming to war &#150; you are
        joking, of course. You would be foolish. If you should
        happen to be drafted (but I thought you was exempt) $300
        would be a cheap sale. I do not hold that it is every
        man&#146;s Duty *to enlist himself*, but to persue every
        exertion to procure them where he can not come
        consistently and I think your case is excusable in all
        respects. But there is no excuse for many - too many even
        in the little town of Ovid. Therefore I say, Draft them,
        the country is of more consequence than their individual
        interests. If they are sacrificed they did it to help a
        Righteous Cause and a cause which must have the
        sacrifice. That&#146;s rather stoical philosophy perhaps
        but it&#146;s true nevertheless. If our rulers would
        allow their judgment to be swayed by their feelings and
        look at individual sorrow and suffering &#150; our
        country would now have been no more &quot;our
        country&quot; but Jeff Davis.</strong></p>
        <p><strong>We are doing nothing here at present. Our
        train is not up yet. I am staying in a &quot;fly&quot; am
        in command of &quot;H&quot; and &quot;B&quot; yet. My
        comsy sergeant Charley Kendall[Charles F Kendall,
        Kalamazoo] received a commission as 1st Lieut. And
        Commissary of the 11th Mich &#150; pretty good for him.
        He deserves it all. Lorenzo[Lorenzo T Southworth, Ovid]
        is my 1st Sergeant. We sleep<br>
        together.<br>
        </strong></p>
        <p><strong>Had quite an excitement yesterday &#150; a
        horserace between the 4th US and the 5th Iowa &#150;
        stakes $50 &#150; 4th US beat. There are some fine horses
        down here. We find them once in a while among the
        mountains. They hide them to keep them from us.</strong></p>
        <p><strong>23 acres of wheat ought to bring a respectable
        crop, say 400 Bus. Is it all on our land or some on
        Hiram&#146;s?</strong></p>
        <p><strong>In the change of commanders and the different
        organization of the army, I think we are better off
        although I have all confidence in Rosecrans yet. In a
        large army there must be unity of action and of purpose.
        Two or three heads independently acting are too many. If
        Burnside had been under<br>
        Rosecrans we would probably have come off ahead. If
        Rosecrans was ordered to take Chattanooga and nothing
        further, he certainly did wrong in moving out from there
        and venturing a battle without reinforcements. At the
        same time if he had been successful he would not have
        been blamed for disobeying orders. It makes all the
        difference in the world which way the cat jumps. But the
        principle is the same. He risked all and lost. Now Grant
        commands the whole three departments Burnside&#146;s,
        Thomas&#146; (Dept of the Cumberland - ours) and
        Hooker&#146;s. I believe we are certain now of success
        whenever we are ready. Bragg cannot get Chattanooga.</strong></p>

        all, Write soon<br>

        Monday November 23rd 1863</strong><p><strong>Dear Father<br>
        I have not had a chance to write a word in some time and
        now [?] the first opportunity. Our regiment left
        Maysville the 17th destination unknown. Only it was
        thought a big raid was contemplated. We were paid up to
        Oct 31st the day we left. We passed thro Stevenson the
        19th. I sent you $400 by Adams Express. The agent
        informed me the line was clear and had not been molested
        in some time. It will reach you all right, no doubt. I
        did not pay charges. I have a Receipt for it with me -
        write me on reception of it. </strong></p>
        <p><strong>My Health is excellent - can eat bacon and
        hard tack right smart. I don&#146;t want to say another
        word about coming home for I don&#146;t see the smallest
        chance at present. Even a certificate of disability comes
        back disapproved, unless it is necessary to save a life.
        So you see my hopes of home are slim and I don&#146;t
        want to disappoint you. As long as I keep well you must
        be satisfied.</strong></p>
        <p><strong>I believe there will be the biggest fighting
        done near here that there has been on the continent and
        the day not far distant either. Our communication must be
        made good at all hazards, that is the first important
        step. At present we run up rations by river to within
        about 8 miles of Chattanooga. From there by wagon Train
        crossing the river twice on Pontoons. The rebels hold the
        point of Lookout Mountain, which runs to the river. I
        have made a sort of a map by which you can form an idea
        of our lines and also the rebels. You will see the road
        our supplies have to come over by water to the jenny then
        by train the rest of the way. Crossing the river twice by
        pontoons. I was on Raccon[Raccoon] Mountains yesterday at
        the signal station which is marked from there you have a
        grand view of both Armies. You can see the rebel tents
        and earthworks plain. It is about 2 ½<br>
        miles air line from the top of Raccoon to Lookout Mt with
        a glass you can see the rebs&#146; quite plain. They kept
        up a cannonading all day yesterday. You would see the
        smoke from our Batteries fifteen seconds before you heard
        the report. Amelia[Amelia Potter, Henry&#146;s Sister]
        can you figure how far<br>
        off? Sound travels 1142 feet per second. The rebels have
        a very large Army. We could not see all of it. A part
        being hid behind Lookout and Missionary Range. Sherman
        was crossing the river all last night with his Corps. We
        are encamped opposite Chattanooga a mile from the river.
        I will<br>
        mark it. The view from the signal Station was the
        grandest sight I ever saw. You can see the mountains of
        North Carolina and north to near Cumberland Gap,
        Kentucky. Then to have spread below you the two great
        armies in the world, seemingly within reach of each
        other. You can imagine<br>
        I cannot tell you anything about it but I must close. I
        will write every opportunity. Write as soon as you
        receive the money. <br>
        Yours affectionately<br>
        Henry A Potter<br>
        Love to all</strong></p>
        <p><strong>You can see the necessity of getting the
        Rebels off Lookout -- as they are now they hold the
        railroad. We must have that at all hazards. Besides the
        river &#150; they have a good line but Grant will
        out-general them.</strong></p>

        Friday Dec 18th 1863</strong><p><strong>Dear Father,
        Mother, and Sister</strong></p>
        <p><strong>You are doubtless very anxious about me and
        think I am killed or captured &#150; sure but I am
        neither &#150; on the contrary am alive and well as ever.
        Have had excellent health since I wrote you last at
        Chattanooga. Since then we have been here and there and
        everywhere. Away from everything and<br>
        everybody part of the time working in rear of the rebels
        and chasing their trains.</strong></p>
        <p><strong>I believe when I wrote you last I told you we
        expected a battle soon and sent you a sketch of the two
        armies as they appeared from Raccoon Mountain and also of
        a pontoon across the river above Chattanooga in the rear
        of the rebel line. Well it came to pass as I anticipated.
        Our Brigade [Minty&#146;s Brigade: 4th Regulars, 7th Penn
        and 4th Mich Cavs -mr] crossed the Tennessee Tuesday the
        24th Nov with Sherman&#146;s Corps and following the line
        of the Knoxville RR burnt the bridges and destroyed all
        commissary stores ,which we found. When we reached
        Cleveland 30 miles from Chattanooga, we had captured and
        burnt 65 wagons and taken over 200 prisoners, burnt all<br>
        bridges of importance , cut telegraphic communications
        between Bragg and Longstreet, -- which was our intention
        when starting on the raid. We started on the 27th ,
        captured about 260 hogs, a first thing for us and
        destroying the Copper Rolling Mill, their only factory of
        *caps* in the Confederacy. It was the grandest sight I
        ever saw, we put 50 boxes of shells and torpedos in the
        walls before firing it and such explosions you never
        heard. The rebels hurried us out quite unceremoniously.
        Our regiment was guarding prisoners. They fired into us
        too fast altogether to suit me. I had one man wounded and
        a horse shot &#150; but further than that all got out
        safely. We then went back to Chattanooga and moved out
        with Sherman to reinforce Burnside at Knoxville. Went as
        far as Loudon when hearing that Longstreet had been
        repulsed and was retreating, we turned off<br>
        to Marysville. From there our Brigade moved over the
        Alleghanies in North Carolina and a hard trip it was, I
        tell you. Rain and cold on the mountains making things
        disagreeable. I have crossed the Cumberland and
        ,Alleghany Mts and been in five rebel states and expect
        to be in all of them<br>
        before I get thru with it. KY Tenn Ga Ala and N.C. We
        found plenty to eat in NC plenty of apples and peach
        brandy. No army had ever troubled them of any size. Lots
        of them never seen a Yankee, as they call us, before.
        They are ignorant and simple - but nearly all stick to
        the old Union, also many have been conscripted &#150;
        most of them were glad to see us.</strong></p>
        <p><strong>I might write you in detail a dozen sheets
        full &#150; but it is not necessary the 4th Mich is now
        on courier duty between Charleston and Chattanooga. I am
        half-way between Charleston and Cleveland. I live in a
        house &#150; have a room by myself and board with the
        family. The are nice folks &#150; although a<br>
        little tainted with secession. </strong></p>
        <p><strong>Did you receive the money I sent you. I have
        not a word from home since the 16th of Nov don&#146;t
        know when we should get any mail. Write as often as you
        can. The great battle was fought while we were raiding in
        Bragg&#146;s rear. I never saw the cause so bright.<br>
        Love to all<br>
        Albert</strong></p>
        <p><strong>[Written over the other letter -mr]<br>
        This is a poor letter but it is better than none. We have
        been busy all the time. I have no time to even think of
        coming home at present. Have not even seen camp since the
        17th Nov when we left Marysville, Alabama. The people are
        nearly all Union here. We have plenty to eat. I am a
        little<br>
        anxious about the money but think it&#146;s all right. </strong></p>
        <p><strong>[written around the edge of the letter -mr]<br>
        You want full accounts of the battle. It was the greatest
        thing. The rebels had a splendid position. Our victory is

        <td width="100%">&nbsp;<b>Henry Albert Potter and the 4th
        Michigan Cavalry, after the stand and retreat at Reed's
        Bridge at the beginning of the battle of Chickamauga,
        were sent North to chase CSA General Longstreet who,
        unwisely perhaps, was sent to attack USA General Burnside
        at Knoxville. While the Union Cavalry was chasing
        Longstreet, the battle of Missionary Ridge (Chattanooga)
        was fought. The inspirational charge by General Hooker's
        troops up Lookout Mountain was made easier by
        Longstreet's removal from the area where Hooker attacked
        and was capped by the flying of the Stars and Stripes
        over the two armies facing each other in the valley
        below. Some feel (cf Peter Cozzens: Shipwreck of Their
        Hopes) that the Stars and stripes flying on top of
        Lookout Mountain before the main battle helped to infuse
        bravery in the Union Troops and depress the Confederates
        and perhaps played a roll in the setback the South
        received on Missionary Ridge. &quot;Corporal Bragg&quot;
        as Potter calls him, was CSA General Braxton Bragg, not a
        popular General even before the defeat at Chattanooga.
        Bragg was removed after the battle by Jefferson Davis and
        replaced by General Joseph E. Johnston. An example,
        possibly apocryphal, of the Confederate soldier's lack of
        respect for Bragg can be shown in an interview Bragg held
        with a Confederate Soldier who was captured by the Union
        Forces during the Battle of Chickamauga and who then was
        recaptured during the pell-mell retreat of the Union
        troops back to Chattanooga. The soldier informed Bragg
        that General Rosecrans and the Union troops were in full
        retreat. Bragg said to him, &quot;Are you sure? Do you
        know what a retreat looks like?&quot; The soldier
        replied, &quot;General, of course I know what a retreat
        looks like, haven't I fought with you for over two
        years&quot;</b></td>

        &amp; that accounts for everything being all right. I am
        getting fat on good living: apples, and Peach Brandy.</b></p>
        <p><b>You have, no doubt, rec&#146;d an account of the
        Great Battle before Chattanooga &#150; well I have not
        had any detail of it at all &#150; but I know Corporal
        Bragg, as the rebels call him, was awfully whipped and
        cut to pieces. I had a grand run of the armies on Sunday
        before the battle from a signal sta on Raccoon Mts, could
        see the whole rebel line their tents and batteries on
        Mission Ridge. They had a grand position. It looked like
        an impossibility to drive them from it. But old US done
        it &amp; the result is that the Confederacy has gone up.
        During the battle a detachment from different brigades,
        the 4th Michigan being one, under Col Long [Eli Long,
        later brigadier General, commander of the 4th Ohio
        Cavalry -mr] crossed the Tennessee above Chattanooga and
        more than slayed the RR to Knoxville, cut the telegraph,
        thus destroying all communications between Bragg and
        Longstreet and forever keeping them apart. We staid at
        Cleveland, the junction between the Eastern and Ga RR
        with the road to Chattanooga, a couple of days. Burnt a
        train of wagons for them, loaded with QM&#146;s stores
        and sutter&#146;s goods &#150; Rebel uniforms were at a
        great discount I tell you. Over 200 prisoners and between
        4 &amp; 500 of the best of their mules. Since then we
        have been bothering Longstreet, chased his train over the
        Alleghaney Mountains into N.C. but did not get it. They
        had too much the start of us. Had a hard trip over the

        <p><b>Dear Folks all</b></p>
        <p><b>I again sit down to tell you that my health remains
        the same. It is rather dull and lonesome, otherwise we
        are enjoying soldier&#146;s life well. Still I had
        something to enliven the time on Tuesday and you may
        congratulate me on my good luck; that I am not now on my
        way to Richmond &#150; that delightful place for poor
        Union Soldiers. I am now stationed six miles from
        Cleveland. I went up there Tuesday, took a man with me,
        to get my horse shod. I took two men with me instead of
        one. There is a Station in charge of a lieutenant. He had
        about 25 men. It is a very exposed point and subject to
        raid by the rebels. Citizens had told Redtelyon(?) that
        they would certainly surprise him. The pickets had been
        fired on several times; but, for the last few days,
        everything had been quiet &#150; no disturbance and I
        thought there was no danger. It was a beautiful day, warm
        as summer. I had just left the Blacksmith shop and my two
        men there and reached the building occupied by the
        Couriers, tied my horse, leisurely lit my pipe and
        commenced smoking, when I heard the darndest yelling that
        ever issued from any human being &#150; apparently from a
        thousand in the direction of the Dalton Road. I sprung
        for my horse, a picket came flying and told us the Rebels
        were on us in strong force. The yelling came like the
        wind and by the time I had mounted, they wheeled(?) the
        corner by the Court House about 30 rods away and I blazed
        away with my pistol and some of the boys fired which
        checked them a short time until the boys had mounted
        their horses &#150; most of them with only a halter --
        the lieut thinking there was no use of trying to stand.
        We moved away slowly firing at them as they came up. They
        did not expect we would fight them and seeing we were not
        disposed to run they got frightened and some of the
        citizens union, telling them they had better get out as
        quick as they could for we had reinforcements, they
        skeddaled back about as fast as they came in. They got
        some of our guns out of the building and blankets. They
        left one man shot through and we had a man wounded. Both
        are alive yet. There was 75 came in town and they had a
        reserve of 100 out in the woods. One of my men at the
        shop got away &#150; the other was captured. He was one
        of my best men named Broman. [Charles Brouman (or Broman)
        from Sparta, Michigan - taken prisoner Dec 22 - died of
        disease at Andersonville May 22, 1864 grave 1288 -mr] We
        came back and held the place until a company of 80 men
        came from Charleston. Col Long&#146;s He&#146;d
        Qrs[Headquarters] to reinforce us. As a courier was sent
        immediately after they had surprised us - 11 miles - They
        evaded the picket and came very near cutting them off.
        Just came in ahead of them, consequently, had no warning
        at all &#150; this route is very much exposed. We are
        liable to be surprised and captured at any time. I have
        only ten men and cannot keep pickets out far enough to
        give much warning. So don&#146;t be surprised if I go to
        Richmond, but rest assured, I am not going if I can help
        it. I am in a good house and have all I want - Roast
        Turkey for dinner. </b></p>

        kept here. News I have none. I know that we are all

        at least, that the war cannot last another year. Do not
        be impatient. I have seen some editorials in Northern
        Papers asking why we do not press on and force battle and
        bring the thing to a close at once. They don&#146;t know
        what they are talking about. If they had seen the poor

        to the Tennessee fighting the great battle at Missionary
        Ridge their coming to Knoxville and driving out
        Longstreet. If they had seen him on the frozen hubs
        &#150; or better had been in his place, they would not
        ask WHY? They would know that they are not only foolish
        but wicked. The soldier must have some rest, he must have
        shoes, he must have clothes. Let them go into camp a few
        weeks, get them shoes, get them clothes, and plenty to
        eat, let them recruit a little, and then they chafe, if

        <td width="100%">&nbsp;<b>Henry Albert Potter tells of a
        gallant defense against a raid by Wheeler and his men. I
        can find no corroboration for this raid in the books I
        have on Wheeler and Dyer only mentions a skirmish at
        Cleveland Dec 29, 1863 with &quot;no reports&quot;. Since
        Potter has received his information 2nd hand, it is
        probably embelished. One would hope any action as large
        as is described should have shown up in Dyer or the OR.
        Wheeler did have a lot of trouble up to and including
        being accused of allowing his men to sack and plunder
        Southerners and disapline appears to have been a problem
        at one point so perhaps it is a band of marauders
        attached to Wheeler. In his defense, Wheeler was well
        enough thought of to command in the United States Army in
        Cuba against Spain in 1898. At any case, a Union wagon
        train was certainly fair game for any Confederate cavalry

        <p><b>Dear Father</b></p>
        <p><b>I am still doing courier duty and am as well as
        usual --- it is a clear cold and windy day --- The ground
        is frozen quite hard. We lack snow to make is seem like
        New Year&#146;s. I have been out to the wood pile
        chopping wood. I came near freezing my ears off, too. The
        people in this country use fireplaces altogether --
        don&#146;t know what a stove is hardly, they are about 50
        years behind the times &#150; but they are clever and
        hospitable and UNION through and through. A man by the
        name of Burton brought us a basket-full of cold chicken
        biscuit, cake and pies this morning as a present. It came
        very acceptable to the boys -- we gave him a lot of
        coffee and sugar a great handy[?] for a person to have in
        this country. Some families here have a son in the
        Federal Army and one also in the Rebel Army. It is no
        uncommon thing to see a father staunch Union and a son
        strong rebel. It is a bad thing to make the best of it,
        when one army holds the country awhile and then the
        other. It gives the little neighborhood jealousies and
        spites a chance to revenge each other. Great time to
        settle old scores. There are always enough mean ones you
        know to take advantage of such things on both sides.
        Makes a very unpleasant State of Society.</b></p>
        <p><b>We Have not bee disturbed yet at our station. There
        was a large train of wagons went up the valley to
        Knoxville last Sunday. Wheeler, who has been raising
        ned&#146; with us all the time at Cleveland, heard of it
        and the wagons were only guarded by about 250 infantry,
        thought he would have a Nice Time and get some sugar and
        coffee for his boys. So he came on after it with about
        1500 cavalry and 3 pieces of artillery. The train passed
        on the same road as the courier line is on, but Wheeler
        came up the valley road east of us about 1 ½ miles only.
        Two little boys from that valley came running over early
        Monday morning to tell us that the rebel were swarming up
        the valley (it&#146;s a good thing to be among your
        friends) We saddled up and moved upon a hill nearby where
        we could see a ½ mile in any direction and staid there
        all day expecting every minute to see a company of Rebels
        come dashing after us. We didn&#146;t ask any odds of
        them. They couldn&#146;t catch us anyhow &#150; but they
        didn&#146;t come &#150; for they had plenty of fish to
        fry. Instead of 250 men with the train we happened to
        have between 4 and 5000 and Col. Long [Eli Long] at
        Calhoun had 500 Cavalry. A dispatch had gone thro&#146;
        telling him Wheeler was coming. So they were ready for
        him. Wheeler&#146;s men had said while going up that
        &quot;Wheeler was H-ll on Wagons&quot; and they would get
        all the sugar and coffee we had. Well - when about 2
        miles from Charleston Wheeler saw the train and ordered a
        charge, the Rebels yelled and plunged forward each man
        trying to be first. But presently crack! crack! whiz!
        bang! A line of smoke 200 yds long rises from the grass
        on their left and the cedars on their right &#150; ah! my
        boys what makes you falter! Why don&#146;t you go on and
        sweeten your coffee &#150; they halted amazed, fired a
        few shots, whirled their horses, run back a quarter of a
        mile, and formed in line of battle. Their Artillery they
        thought would be up soon and the wagons would be theirs
        &#150; but Fate was against them. The artillery was stuck
        in the mud and didn&#146;t come at all. The infantry were
        moving slowing upon them and at that moment Col Long with
        his gallant little 500 were seen with sabres drawn -
        coming up like the wind - at the command Charge! Boys
        Charge! The Infantry gave way and Long was upon them like
        an avalanche, cutting thro&#146; their line and in their
        rear the work of death commenced, in 15 minutes we had
        140 prisoners and had killed 30. The rebels were flying
        from the field in every direction terror stricken and
        helpless they threw away over 400 guns. Wheeler only had
        40 men with him when he went back, the rest were
        scattered. He was never so badly whipped before or so
        badly misinformed &#150; in fact he got his foot in it
        sure. Prisoner say he is superseded &#150; they

        lost. Our business is to whip the rebel army and beat and
        destroy it. We are not to be used in any political manner
        whatsoever in order to be successful. Maj Gen
        Sherman&#146;s politics suit me exactly. McClellan I
        [judge] to be a Union man but the influence which would
        be brought to bear on him by the Reactionary Peace Party
        should not be risked. I am opposed to a change in
        administration but wish Lincoln would not listen to the
        New England fanatics so much </b></p>

        <p><b>Dear Sister</b></p>
        <p><b>I rec&#146;d a paper from you this morning a
        Cincinnati Times but letters are out of the question it
        appears as I have rec&#146;d but one from P.le. Blaskett
        since in Nashville. Our regiment came from Ooltawah on
        the cars. At Decherd I stopped for breakfast and who
        should I see there but George Rawlings of Red House and
        Cherry fame. He is doing a smashing business at that
        place. His wife looked as natural as life as well as
        himself. Had a good meal ended with a real old doughnut
        twister just such as we have at home. My health is a
        little below par, we have had very unpleasant weather,
        rainy and windy. I have taken cold in some way but it
        won&#146;t last long. I have been down town several times
        attended the theater saw the great Couldocle(?) and his
        daughter in the play of the Returned Convict. There is a
        rumor that we move to Columbia soon. Division Hed Qrs are
        there now. 38 miles from Nashville. Col Park [Lt Col
        Josiah B Park, Ovid, Mich] is in command now and is in
        good health. Carter[Lt Julius M Carter, Ovid, Mich] has
        been back some time. I suppose you are making lots of
        maple sugar about this time. I wish I could be there to
        get some today &#150; never mind. Some of these days
        I&#146;ll pop in maybe but I don&#146;t think it will be
        very soon. I believe I am unlucky but maybe all for the
        best. I rec&#146;d a letter from Elder Bassett, a very
        good one too. I have not answered it yet. Haven&#146;t
        anything new to write to anyone. </b></p>
        <p><b>My love to you and to all. </b></p>
