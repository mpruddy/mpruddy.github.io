		<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify"><font size="4">The 
	revolutionary movement of 1848 had failed. Mitchel, Meagher, Doheny, 
	O'Brien, O'Doherty, OMahony, O'Donoghue, O'Gorman, Stephens, MacManus and 
	the chief men connected with it had been banished from the land, the spirits 
	of the people were depressed and the ground was clear for the constitutional 
	agitators to play their game again. The Keoghs and the Sadliers come into 
	the field and laid the foundation of their work, and in 1852 they and their 
	policy had full swing. Sadlier committed suicide on Hemsptead Heath, London, 
	and his death was the precursor of the collapse of the Brass Band, as that 
	band of agitators was then called. The Crimean war was raging in 1853; there 
	was hardly en English soldier left in Ireland; even the ranks of the Irish 
	police were thinned by volunteers to the land transport corps that was 
	organized for service in the Crimea; it was one of those &quot;opportunities&quot; 
	that impractical, theoretical Irishmen are always hoping for, that Ireland 
	was asleep and none of her sons thought of availing of &quot;England's 
	difficulty.&quot; I have ever since that time looked with a kind of contempt upon 
	men that I hear talking of England's difficulty being Ireland's opportunity, 
	and upon men that I hear singing &quot;watch and wait and bide your time,&quot; The 
	man who wrote &quot; Watch and wait and bide your time&quot;— Michael Joseph 
	Barry—ended his days on earth a sworn servant of England; the man who prate 
	of England's difficulty being Ireland's Opportunity have little better stuff 
	in them than he had. The men who have mettle in them to fight their 
	country's battle for freedom are men who make their opportunities.</font></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify"><font size="4">During those 
	years of depression in Ireland after '43, Lord John Russell was Prime 
	Minister in England, and in 1851 he thought it would be a good stroke of 
	policy to lower the pretensions of the Catholic hierarchy of 
	Ireland;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; he introduced into Parliament the Ecclesiastical Titles 
	bill and had it passed into law. This bill made it a penal offense for any 
	Catholic bishop to call himself bishop of any particular place or diocese; 
	but no sooner was it passed into law than Archbishop McHale wrote a letter 
	to the press and signed it &quot;John, Archbishop of Tuam.&quot; This was throwing 
	down the gauntlet to the British ministry, but they did not take it up; they 
	did not prosecute Archbishop although ha dared them to do so; but the 
	Ecclesiastical Titles bill remains still on the stratute books of England, 
	to be revived perhaps at some future time, just as penal laws passed two 
	hundred years ago were revived against the Irish people in the Land League 
	movement a few years ago. England has always a reserve force of law to meet 
	every phase of Irish discontent, or if she has not, she very readily makes a 
	law to meet it.</font></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify"><font size="4">The 
	population of Ireland in 1845 was about nine millions; in 1851 it was 
	between six and seven millions. Fully two millions of people wore lost to 
	the country by starvation and emigration. Not that the country did not 
	produce food sufficient to support six or nine millions of people—the 
	English statistics show that during these years called &quot;the famine years&quot; 
	Ireland raised food enough to support 16,000,000 of people; but the potato 
	crops failed during the years 1845, 1846 and 1847, and the landlords seized 
	the grain crops and cattle for their rents. From 1848 to 1851 the country 
	and the people seemed stagnant; much of the land remained uncultivated and 
	produced nothing but weeds; many of the landlords themselves became poor and 
	needy, because they could not levy rents and taxes off of thistles, dock 
	leaves and gaosadawns, hence the passage in the English Parliament some time 
	after of a bill called the Incumbered Estates bill, by the power and 
	operation of which many of there lands were sold and passed into the 
	possession of new landlords. The old landlords, though bad, wore not worse 
	than the new ones; the old landlords had their titles from the sword, the 
	new landlords had their titles from their money, and demanded their money's 
	worth from the tenants. They never dream that they paid their money for 
	stolen property. This is a thing the Irish people never forget; the claim to 
	the land of their fathers they never forego. This in the secret of the 
	existence of Fenianism. Fenianism is but the name in our day of that fight 
	which has existed in Ireland against England during the past seven 
	centuries—a fight transmitted from bleeding sire to son. I think it is 
	Thierry, the historian of the Norman Conquest, who says that no nation on 
	earth presents a grander spectacle to the peoples of the world than does 
	this little nation called Ireland, that for six hundred years or more has 
	carried on the fight of right against might. As one generation rose and 
	fought and fell, another generation rose to fight and fall again—ever 
	defeated, but never conquered.</font></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify"><font size="4">About the 
	year 1854 Charles Gaven Duffy was member of Parliament for New Ross; I was 
	in the town of Tralee one day; I bought a copy of the <i>Dublin Nation</i> 
	newspaper, I read in it an address from Gavan Duffy to the people of New 
	Ross and of Ireland; he said he lost all hope of being able to do any good 
	for Ireland in the English Parliament. Ireland was 54 a corpse on the 
	dissecting table, and he was going to leave it and seek his fortune In 
	Australia. He went, sought his fortune there, found it, got honors and 
	knighthood from England's governor in the far off land; is back to Ireland 
	again and writing with seeming sorrow that he had abandoned the ship when 
	she seemed sinking.</font></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify"><font size="4">In 1857 the 
	Indian mutiny broke out; it put England to the pin of her collar to put it 
	down; she again drew her forces from Ireland and hardly a redcoat was to be 
	seen in the land. Some young men in the south of Ireland, in a town where I 
	lived, called Skibbereen, had started a society with a view to educate 
	themselves and educate the country around into national life and activity. I 
	was among these young men. Colonel Patrick J. Downing, now of Washington; 
	Daniel O'Crowly, city register, Springfield, Ill.; John O’Driscoll, school 
	teacher, Boston, and some others at present scattered through America, were 
	among them. The society was called or christened the Phenix National and 
	Literary Society. Ireland was dead, but from the ashes of her martyred 
	nationality she should phenix-like, arise again. I think I used those words 
	when proposing the name for the society. Patrick Downing seconded the 
	motion. Daniel O'Crowley proposed a different name, but the Phenix carried 
	the day. The name was adopted by the Irishmen of America, and a paper was 
	started by John O’Mahony, called the Phenix, but the name Fenian was 
	subsequently substituted for the organization in America, and by degrees 
	came to be given to the organization in Ireland. The organization started in 
	Ireland by James Stephens was the I. R. B., the Irish Revolutionary 
	Brotherhood, but that too got the name of the Phenix Society at first; it 
	was as a member of the Phenix Society I was prosecuted before Judge Keogh, 
	in 1859, though it was in connection with the working of the I. R. B. 
	Society I was arrested. The Phenix Society was a national literary society, 
	having no oath of membership. The English Government were in the dark at the 
	time, and confounded one with the other. The Phenix Society was literary end 
	educational. It also fostered the spirit of nationality, and to spread that 
	spirit the members held correspondence with acquaintances they had in 
	distant towns and cities, held soirees and parties, made speeches and had 
	them published in the papers. Some of these speeches, made at a soiree given 
	in the Phenix Rooms on the night of New Year's day, 1857, were published in 
	the <i>Dundalk Democrat</i>. The paper reached John O’Mahony and James 
	Stephens. They saw there was growing national life in Ireland, and, ever 
	watchful to forward the cause both had suffered for, they resolved to try 
	Ireland again. In the month of May, 1858, James Stephons visited Skibbereen; 
	he brought with him to one of the members of our society a letter of 
	introduction from O'Mahony, of Bandon, a brother to the Rev. Thaddeus 
	O'Mahony, of Trinity College, Dublin. The day after James Stephens visited 
	Skibbereen I was sworn in a member of the Irish Revolutionary Brotherhood, 
	and I was commissioned to swear in others. It was work such as I wanted, 
	such as I was longing for, and I went at it with a will. I was at home, and 
	I knew all the people in the five parishes around, and the people in the 
	five parishes knew me and all belonging to me. I had no bad drop in me; and 
	when I asked a man would he become a soldier for Ireland he had no fear I 
	was going to betray him, and I had no difficulty in swearing him in. I swore 
	in Colonel Downing, of Washington, the day after I was sworn in myself. I 
	swore in Morty Moynahan—a man who did more than any other man in the south 
	of Ireland to spread the organization in its early days. Morty was chief 
	clerk to McCarthy Downing, one of the principal attorneys in the County 
	Cork; he used to accompany him to all the sessions and Assizes held in all 
	the towns from Skibbereen to Cork; no client could approach the attorney 
	without first being handled by Morty, and where Morty met a man of good old 
	Irish stock, with the hatred of England impregnated in his blood, he never 
	let him out of his hands until he swore him in. Both man and master are now 
	dead. Few men I mot in the movement truer to Ireland or more devoted to her 
	cause then Morty Moynahan; to write of that cause and to forget him and his 
	work would be treason.</font></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify"><font size="4">In May, 
	1858, the I. R. B. work commenced in Skibbereen, and before August we had 
	some 3,000 men enrolled; they expected a fight immediately, and were calling 
	for drill instruction and arms. Of course, we told our men, as told to us, 
	that the whole of Ireland &nbsp;was similarly organized, and that when we came to 
	fight it would be a fight general throughout all Ireland. &quot;Bheirim le Dia,&quot; 
	said Curly Batt McCarthy (Sowney) to me one nay, “if all Ireland have as 
	little trouble with their share of the English garrison as we will have, it 
	will be easy work with them, because we could take all the enemy in this 
	part of the country and eat them fur breakfast without having a surfeit from 
	them.” This was the acme Corly Batt who, when Stephens was telling him in my 
	house that after the war, landlordism would be abolished and I every man 
	would be his own landlord, cried out : &quot;Dar Fis, captain, that won't satisfy 
	me; I won't be satisfied till I make them pay back the back rents they have 
	n been drawing from us those long and many years past.&quot; Corly belonged to 
	old Irish family of the MacCarthys, who had owed the vary land for which he 
	was then paying rent to an English landlord who had ownership of it through 
	descent from one of the Cromwellian troopers. Corly Batt McCarthy was about 
	60 years of age when I swore him into the organization; he is dead now, but 
	his spirit lives at home, and as long as that spirit lives England's power 
	is in peril.</font></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify"><font size="4">Why such 
	movements as the Fenian movement exist in Ireland and never die is because 
	that the count try is peopled north, south, east and west by men and women 
	who hold such traditions as this Curly Batt McCarthy had—traditions that 
	tell them they are the victims of English greed and plunder, and that they 
	would be cravens and recreant to the spirit of their martyred dead if they 
	ever gave up the fight for which those martyred ancestors of theirs fought 
	and bled. Corly was a fair representative type of an Irishman. His like is 
	to be met with in every barony in Ireland, and the cause of the existence of 
	Fenianism will be understood better by readers when I tell of his 
	circumstances and surroundings. He was one of the good old Irish stock; his 
	family or clan having for centuries been bred, born and reared in the 
	locality; he was more or less remotely or immediately connected with every 
	other old Irish clan or family in the barony, and his history is the history 
	of the Irish people. He would tell of how his fathers had lost the greater 
	portion of their lands in the big confiscations and how they had lost what 
	remained of them because they would not give up the old faith; how they were 
	fined and confined because they would not go to church or cease going to 
	Mass, till at length the fines became so numerous and so heavy, that the 
	very houses in which they lived were auctioned off to pay them. Every child 
	of Ireland learns this history of Ireland at his mother's knees—learns how 
	in olden times his people were a great people and had estates of their own 
	till the Sassenagh invader came in and plundered them. Corly Batt and men 
	like him at the weddings and wakes of the people would tell how, after they 
	were stripped of all their worldly goods by the Sassenegh, the Sassenagh 
	would then order them to leave the country for fear in their poverty they 
	would be an expense or a trouble to the English settlers. I learned those 
	historical facts before I learned to read; many of my readers now may think 
	they are not historical facts and may question the accuracy or authenticity 
	of these traditions the Irish people carry with them, so just here I will 
	give a few extracts from the statute books of England, which may be seen in 
	the Brooklyn Public Library, showing that all I say on this head is true:</font></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify"><font size="4">In the first 
	year of the reign of Elizabeth this law was passed:</font></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify"><font size="4">Statute 
	Section 8—And that from and after the Feast of tine Nativity of Saint John 
	Baptist next coming all and every person and persons inhabiting within this 
	realm, or any other, the Queen's Majesty's dominions, shall diligently and 
	faithfully, having no lawful or reasonable excuse to be absent, endeavor 
	themselves to resort to their parish church or chapel accustomed, or, upon 
	reasonable lot thereof, to some usual place where common prayer and such 
	service of God shall be held in such time of lot, upon every Sunday and 
	other days ordained and need to be kept as holy days, and then and there to 
	abide orderly and soberly during the time of the common prayer, upon pain of 
	punishment by the censures of the church, and also upon pain that every 
	person so offending shall forfeit for any such offense twelve pence, to be 
	levied by the church wardens of the parish where such offense shall be done, 
	of the goods, lands and tenants of such offender by way of distress.</font></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify"><font size="4">&nbsp;</font></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify"><font size="4">Now comes a 
	fine of 100 marks and a year's imprisonment for hearing mass:</font></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify"><font size="4">Statute 23, 
	Elizabeth, Chapter I—And be it likewise enacted that every person which 
	shall say or sing mass, being thereof lawfully convicted, shall forfeit the 
	sum of 200 marks and be committed to prison In the next jail, there to 
	remain for the space of one year, and thenceforth till he have paid the said 
	sum of 200 marks; and that every person which shall hear mass shall forfeit 
	the sum of 100 marks and suffer imprisonment for a year.</font></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify"><font size="4">Be it, also 
	further enacted by the authority aforesaid that every person above the age 
	of sixteen years which shall not repair to some church, chapel or usual 
	place of common prayer, but forbear the same, contrary to the tenor of the 
	statute made in the first year of her Majesty's reign, and being thereof 
	lawfully convicted, shell forfeit to the Queen's Majesty for every month 
	after the end of thin session of Parliament £20 of lawful English money, and 
	that, over and beside the said forfeitures, every person so forbearing by 
	the space of twelve months shall for his or her obstinacy be bound with two 
	sufficient sureties in the sum of £200, at the least, to be of good behavior 
	and so to continue bound until such time as the persons so bound do conform 
	themselves and come to the church.</font></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify"><font size="4">See. 6. And 
	be it further enacted that if any person or persons shall keep or maintain 
	any schoolmaster which shall not repair to church as in aforesaid, he shall 
	forfeit and lose for every month so keeping him £10. And any such 
	schoolmaster or teacher presuming to teach contrary to this act, and being 
	thereof lawfully convicted, shall be disabled to be a teacher of youth and 
	shall suffer imprisonment, without bail or main prize, for one year. </font>
		</p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify"><font size="4">The Irish 
	were not becoming Englishly religious enough, or the work of stripping them 
	of their lands and money was not going cm fast enough so the 29<sup>th</sup> 
	of Elizabeth, section 3, enacts, &quot;That every such offender in not repairing 
	to Divine service, but forbearing the same contrary to the said statute, as 
	hath been heretofore convicted for such an offense, and hath not made 
	submission, shall without any other indictment or conviction pay into the 
	receipt of the said exchequer all such sums of money, as according to the 
	rate of twenty pounds for every month since the same conviction. And if 
	default shall be made in any part of any payment aforesaid, that then and so 
	often the Queen's Majesty shall and may take, seize and enjoy all the goods, 
	and parts as well of all the lands, tenements and hereditaments, leases and 
	farms of such offenders, leaving the third part only of the same lands, 
	tenements and hereditaments, leases and farms to and for the maintenance and 
	relief of the same offender, his wife, children and family.&quot;&nbsp; 
		</font></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify"><font size="4">Then again, 
	the thirty-fifth of Elizabeth, section one, declares that the offenders who 
	will obstinately remain Catholics &quot;shall be committed to prison, there to 
	remain without bail or main prize until they shall conform and yield 
	themselves to come to the usual place of common prayer.&quot;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
		</font></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify"><font size="4">At that time 
	the English, it seems, had the Irish prisons full of Irish people whom they 
	had robbed of all their worldly goods, and whom they could not persuade to 
	&quot;turn&quot; to the English church for consolation; they must have found that the 
	expense of supporting them in prison was no small thing; so they became 
	magnanimous enough to give them their liberty&nbsp; on condition of quitting the 
	country, and never showing their faces in it again. To carry out that part 
	of the programme this law was passed:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
		</font></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify"><font size="4">35th of 
	Elizabeth: chapter 2, section 6—And to the&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; end that the realm be not 
	pestered or overcharged with the multitude of such seditious and dangerous 
	people as is aforesaid, who having little or no ability to answer or satifie 
	any competent penalty for their contempt and disobedience of the said laws 
	and statutes, and being committed to prison for the same, do live for the 
	most part in better ease there than they could if they were abroad at their 
	own liberty. The Lords Spiritual and Temporal, and the Commons in this 
	present Parliament assembled, do most humbly and instantly beseech the 
	Queen's Majesty that it may be further enacted that any such person or 
	persons, being a Popish recusant, etc., shall abjure this realm of England, 
	and all other, the Queen's Majesty's dominions forever, and thereupon shall 
	depart out of this realm, at such haven or port, and within such time as 
	shall in their behalf be assigned and appointed by the said justices of the 
	peace or coroner before whom such abjurations shall be made, unless the same 
	offenders be letted or stayed by such lawful and reasonable means or causes, 
	as by the common laws of this realm are permitted and allowed in cases of 
	abjuration or felony.</font></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify"><font size="4">There were 
	two forms of the oath of abjuration. </font></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify"><font size="4">This was 
	one:</font></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify"><font size="4">You shall 
	swear that you shall depart out of this realm of England and out of all 
	others the King's Majesty's dominions; and that you shall not return hither, 
	or come again into any of his Majesty's dominions, but by the license of our 
	said Sovereign Lord the King. So help you, God.</font></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify"><font size="4">Here was the 
	other form:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
		</font></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify"><font size="4">This hear 
	you, Sir Coroner, that I, ------------- am a Popish recusant, and in 
	contempt of the laws and statutes of this realm of England, I have and do 
	refuse to come to hear divine service there read and exercised. I do, 
	therefore, according to the intent and meaning of the statute, made in the 
	thirty-fifth year of the reign of Queen Elizabeth, late Queen of this realm 
	of England, abjure the land and realm of King Charles, now King of England, 
	Scotland, France and Ireland; and I shall haste me toward the Port of 
	-------, which you have given and assigned to me. And that I shall not go 
	out of the highway leading thither, nor return again, and if I do, I will 
	that I be taken as a felon of our said Lord the party King. And that at 
	----- I will diligently seek for passage, and I will tarry there but one 
	flood and ebb if I can have passage; and unless I can have it in such place, 
	I will go every day into the sea up to my knees essaying to pass over. So 
	help me God and His holy judgment.</font></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify"><font size="4">When I heard 
	stories in my youth, of how our people were great people in olden times and 
	how they had houses and lands and estates of their own—all which they lost 
	because of their sticking to the true faith—I thought in my innocence that 
	our people were only putting on airs, but when I came to read in history the 
	very stories I heard before I was able to read I began to see how 
	historically true wore the tradition of the people. While the Irish people 
	have those traditions—and it is very likely they will have them forever—they 
	can never be reconciled to English rule. </font></p>

		<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify"><font size="4">Where wounds

		<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify"><font size="4">All the 
	ameliorations that all the Parnells in creation could got passed in the 
	Parliament could not reconcile the Irish to English rule, England knows 
	this, &nbsp;and this, no doubt, is at the bottom of her desire to see the Irish 
	living in any other land on earth than Ireland; this, no doubt, was at the 
	bottom of the desire she had last year to get rid of the Irish paupers she 
	had made by shipping them to America; that, together with getting rid of the 
	expense of supporting them in a poorhouse prison.</font></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify"><font size="4">Ancther 
	of the causes that make Fenianism, or any other movement of opposition to 
	English government rife in Ireland is this: That Ireland has knowledge that 
	England has destroyed Irish trade and manufacture; that England bee passed 
	laws aimed deliberately at the destruction of the industries of the Irish 
	people that she has done this to compel the Irish people to use the goods 
	manufactured by the English people When Ireland's population war less than 
	it is now, Ireland had her factories for the manufacture of every thing that 
	was necessary to a people and to a nation and she exported to other nations 
	much of her native produce. England killed all that. The Irish people have 
	traditions that they one time had shipping of their own and traded with 
	Spain and Portugal and France and Italy and other countries. England laid 
	tax or embargo on everything that was conveyed in ships that were not 
	English and thus destroyed the Irish shipping trade. The Irish people know 
	that they once had a parliament of their own, and , had and bigoted as that 
	parliament was for a long time, England destroyed that, too. She spent a 
	couple of millions of pounds sterling—name ten millions of dollars—in 
	bribing the members of it, who were half English already, and they voted 
	that an Irish Parliament was a humbug.. It really was a humbug, because it 
	would not allow a Catholic Irishman to be a member of it, while four-fifths 
	of the Irish people were Catholics. I don't see why the Irish people cry so 
	much about it. Henry Grattan, who was a member of it—one of the greatest of 
	its members—would not even allow a Catholic to become a member of the Irish 
	Volunteers, even when the question was proposed in that Irish Parliament 
	that Catholics be eligible for membership in the Irish Volunteers. “What!” 
	said he, “we have hitherto been the armed property; are we now to become the 
	armed beggary?”</font></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify"><font size="4">The Irish 
	Volunteers were officered by the English landlords of Ireland. I could never 
	bring myself to cry after them; they would have no liberty that would give 
	freedom to Catholic Irishmen, and, as I say, four-fifths of the people were 
	Catholic. The freedom that would not hold emancipate and free the whole 
	people of a nation is not worth having or worth fighting for. I would not 
	risk the shredding of a drop of blood for a native Irish Parliament such as 
	Grattan and those people had in Ireland one hundred years ago.</font></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify"><font size="4">A true 
	history of Ireland cannot be written without writing of religion and the use 
	that was made of it for purposes of conquest. When the cause of the 
	existence of Fenianism is considered it must be considered how England 
	latterly made use of religion to give confirmation to her conquest in 
	Ireland — indeed, not latterly but formerly as well. When England became 
	Protestant she tried to make Ireland Protestant, and the Irish did not 
	“turn;” but when England came to Ireland first, and when both countries 
	remained Catholic for 300 years, England struck Ireland as mercilessly 
	during those first 300 years that she was Catholic she struck during the 
	last 300 years that she is Protestant. The feeling naturally grew into the 
	minds of the Irish people that the plunderers and the Protestants were one 
	and the same people. They had their traditions of how their fathers were 
	fined and confined for not going to church (as the Protestant place of 
	worship is called in Ireland), and they had their experience of how they 
	themselves had to pay the tenth part of their worldly wealth to support the 
	Protestant Church. The war of the tithes was a war of our own day; the 
	people resisted the tax gatherers, or the tithe gatherers, who used to come 
	into the Catholic fields, and with their spade handles measure out every 
	tenth ridge of potatoes and put a mark on it that made it sacred to the use 
	of Protestant ministers. The riots that used to take place over the digging 
	of those Catholic potatoes for the Protestant minister induced the English 
	Government to change the manner of collecting the minister's tithes, The 
	tenth part of the tenants rent was collected from the tenant's landlord, but 
	when that law was made, the landlord said he was not going to be the loser 
	by it; so he gave notice to the tenant that he would have to pay an 
	increased rent in future. Those tithes wore abolished altogether lately; it 
	was no relief to the Irish tenant farmers except a sentimental one; it did 
	not reduce the tenant's rent a penny or a pound. It was the landlord was 
	paying the tithes; it was the landlord's grievances were redressed. When the 
	tithes were put upon his shoulders, he raised the rent on the tenant ; when 
	they wore taken off his shoulders he did not take the increased rent off the 
	shoulders of the tenant. It strikes me that the people of any country would 
	be as rebelliously disposed as the Irish if they were similarly treated by 
	their governors. It strikes me that Mr. Talmage or Mr. Beecher would protest 
	against having his household goods seized by a bailiff because he was not 
	going to Bishop Lougblin’s mass every Sunday morning, or because he was not 
	paying a tenth part of his industry's earnings to support Bishop Loughlin's 
	house. These you may think are continental grievances in Ireland now; they 
	were not in my day, they are not to-day, The English alien government is in 
	Ireland; it has its agents there collecting taxes in one shape or another. 
	It is to benefit England not to benefit Ireland the English are in Ireland. 
	It is to drive the English out the Fenian movement was started.</font></p>
