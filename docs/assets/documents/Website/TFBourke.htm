Putnam<b> </b>McCabe, Bourke sprung from the people. We learn that both of his
parents belonged to the most respectable of those families, known in Ireland as
&quot;the middle class.&quot; His father was a man of marked intelligence, and
more than the average education of persons engaged in trade. He carried on the
painting and decorating business successfully for many years, and, as well from
his cleverness and in­</span><span style="letter-spacing: -.4pt">dustry, as
from his family connection with many of the</span><span style="letter-spacing: -.3pt">
professional men and better class of farmers, enjoyed a large share of the
contracts in his county. No man stood higher in his community, than the good
father of this good son, who was one of six children. The results of the famine
year, which were felt so heavily in the south and west, materially affected Mr.
Bourke's business, so much so indeed, that emigration from the isle of sorrow
was suggested, and accepted as the only means of affording his young family that
present care and future prospect, which his heart prompted him to give them. In
1850, Mr. Bourke and his fam­ily arrived in New York, and commenced the world
anew. His days were spent in providing the means of physical sustenance for his
children, his evening leisure hours to the imparting of such literary aliment to
them as his early habits enabled him to bestow. At </span><span style="letter-spacing: -.4pt">the
end of two years, he had acquired a modest compe</span><span style="letter-spacing: -.3pt">­</span><span style="letter-spacing: -.4pt">tency,
when the failing health of his wife demanded im</span><span style="letter-spacing: -.3pt">­mediate
removal; and the family, leaving New York, settled in St. Johns, Newfoundland,
to commence life for the third time. Mr. Bourke's attention and in­dustry
produced their inevitable reward, and he had<o:p>

father's business, so much so, that he was permitted to travel &quot;on his own
responsibilities.&quot; He bent his steps to Boston, where another relative
lived and flourished. Here he settled and worked, and won not only a manly
independence for himself, but a surplus, which he nobly contributed to the
family fund at Toronto. His father's health continued to break ; his exertions
had been unremitting, his physical ability overtasked, in 1858 he became
helpless, and thenceforth we are told the entire support of father, mother,
three sisters and a boy brother, devolved solely on the stout heart and skilful
hand of the dauntless youth, the subject of this sketch, who remitted his bank
cheque to Canada with the regularity of Saturday night's succes­sion. At length
the father died, and selling out their pretty little cottage in the suburbs of
Toronto, Mrs. Bourke and her children removed to New York. Here the girls, now
approaching womanhood, found work for their industrious fingers, and relieved
their brother in part, of the burden he had so loyally and lovingly borne. The
family became very happy together, and Mr. M. J. Heffernan, to whom we are
indebted for many of the facts here narrated, gives us a graphic and touching
view of the sayings and doings</span>

He says it was a great treat to their few and select friends to visit them of an
evening. &quot; Poor Toni came in from his day's work, with his pleasant smile
and his cheery laugh, and his little sister picked up her books and slate and
made way for Tom to kiss dear mother; and then his grown up sisters come in, and
they had such welcome for each other as though they had been all absent for
years. And then they sat down to tea in such a jolly humor, and talked over old
times, and old struggles, and old friends, and of the little brother at school,
in Canada, under the guardianship of the relative above mentioned; and when the
tea things were removed they read a while from books of their intelligent
mother's choosing, and from the morning <span style="letter-spacing:-.1pt">papers,
which Tom was always sure to fetch home, and</span> from some national journal,
which they received from an unforgetful friend in the old country. And then they
chatted a while, and their fond mother, and one of the truest types of a true
mother, told them stories of a time and a country which the elder children could
not more than remember, and which the young­er ones never saw; and she related
passages of that country's most melancholy history, and named the books in which
the episodes could be found, and they read these books as soon after as
possible; and she told them stories of wrongs and sufferings, which their race
had been made to bear, some printed in books, and some which were printed
nowhere but in the burning memories of Irish people. She explained to them how
it came about that such a race<o:p>

affairs demands that we should run the risk. But, allowing the impossibility of
our attaining the great object of our lives at present, a 'rising<sup>'</sup> in
Ireland now cannot be otherwise than a success, for it is indispen­sable to the
very life of the cause. Let us see how the case stands. You know, as well as I
do, that the only hope of Ireland's redemption rests with the 'Irish Nation in
America,' and you know that that new nation has the will and the power to make
Ireland<sup>'</sup>s freedom a certainty. You know that so far from proving this
doctrine to be fallacious, the ill-directed and badly managed Fenian Brotherhood
has fully demonstrated what an immense power this new Irish nation might he
under honest and able guidance. Yea know, that in proper hands, it could tear
Ireland from the united grasp of all Europe. But to be of any use whatever, in
that direction, it is absolutely necessary that a clear understanding should
exist between the Irish exiles here, and the patriots who may still remain on
their native soil. They should regard each other with more. than brotherly love,

from what cause, but that feeling of mutual faith and reliance grows weaker and
weaker every day. It must be re-inspired and strengthened at any cost, or
effective work for Ireland will be rendered impossible. The injudicious course
hitherto pursued by Mr. Stephens has left the men at home under a strong
impression that they have been abandoned by their brothers in America. If we
allow that impression to remain, they will never trust us again, and then
good-bye to all hope for Ireland 1 It must, I say, be removed at any cost I Now,
who is to remove it ? The wily enemy is now at work, in press and pulpit, aided

people, here and at home, in their leaders—to prove that these leaders have,
through sordid and other unworthy motives, led their confiding followers into a
trap, and then abandoned them. It must be confessed that the conduct of Stephens
has given this villainous slander a very plausible appear­ance of truth. He,
having made that disastrous pledge, should have redeemed it with his life. His
failure or folly must completely demoralize the people, if it be not
counteracted. It <i><span style="letter-spacing: 1.0pt">must </span></i>be.

belie the assertions that we are urged to this course by any selfish
consideration whatever, or even that impru­dence had any share in the matter.
You are aware that within the past two months we have received despatches from
every district in Ireland, all bearing the same burden—all chorusing the same
tune—all beseeching us to go to them at once, no matter what means we
possessed, and help them to fight the good fight, which they would immediately
inaugurate with-out us in case we failed to be at their head. If we oppose them
now, our own brothers in Ireland will be the most persistent and vehement
maligners of the Irish race in America. What will be the result ? The men at
home will never trust us again, and then, I repeat, farewell to Irish
Regeneration! They, not we, are </span><i><span style="font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Bookman Old Style&quot;">forcing

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It was proved by one Edward Brett, a servant of Mr. James
Bartel, of Thomastown, that having been sent for bread on the morning of the 6th
March, he was stopped on his return, and from statements made to him he brought
the bread to Ballyhurst Fort, where Bourke, who was lame, distributed it among
the men. Sub-inspector Wm. Kelly, who had seen Bourke in the month previous,
described him as &quot; a man with a broken up constitution, and not capable of
much physical exertion.<o:p>

  a Fenian meeting held. Some of the Irish Centres were present. General Halpin
  was present. I cannot think of the names of all, but about thirty were
  present. I am not sure whether the prisoner, Colonel Bourke, was there.
  Stephens presided at the meeting. Stephens made a statement. showing the
  amount of war material held by the Brotherhood at New York. He said that the
  amount was not one-seventh of the minimum fixed by himself. He said that the
  mini-mum was thirty thousand rifles. He objected to open the fight, as he had
  promised, but to prove his fidelity to Ireland, he offered to come <i><span style="letter-spacing: .5pt">over

  hanged. That proposition was scouted by every one, and it was determined that
  the fight should be opened. I knew a person named Captain M'Cafferty. He was
  at that meeting. Some even­ings after that, Stephens convened another
  meeting. About twenty officials were present at that meeting. It was purely a
  military one. M'Cafferty wanted to <i><span style="letter-spacing: .5pt">know </span></i>the
  plan of the campaign. Stephens did not like to mention it. I said that M<sup>'</sup>Cafferty
  was right, and supported his motion to divulge the pl<span style="letter-spacing:1.15pt">an</span>
  of the campaign to his officers. That was what turned out afterwards to be the

  them money; £30 would cover what each got. I stated to them that the money
  was given for the support of the organization. At that meeting an address was
  drawn up con-jointly by three. It was discussed as they went along—that is,
  para­graph by paragraph. It spoke about the wrongs of Ireland, and called
  upon the people to take up arms, and invoking the sympathy and aid of the
  working men of England. I came to Dublin on the 11th February. There was a
  meeting of Centres hold the next day. O'Beirne was there. The Centres stated
  the numerical strength, material of war, and the number of arms held by each.

  Lords it is not my intention to occupy much of your time in answering the
  question why the sentence of the court should not now be passed on me. But I
  may, with your permission, review a little of the evidence that has been
  brought against me. The first evidence that I would speak of, is that of
  Sub-Inspector Kelly, who had the conversation with me in Clonmel, in Tipperary.
  He states that he asked either &quot;How was my friend,&quot; or &quot; What
  about my friend Stephens,&quot; and that I made answer and said he was the
  most idolized man that ever had been, or ever would be, in America. Here,
  standing on the brink of my grave, in the presence of the Almighty and
  Ever-Living God, I brand that as being the foulest perjury that ever man gave
  utterance to. No such conversation ever occurred. The name of Stephens was not
  mentioned. I shall pass from that, and then touch on the evidence of Britt. He
  states that I assisted in distributing the bread to the parties in the fort,
  and that I stood with him in the wagon or cart. That is also false. I was not
  in the fort at the time at all ; I was not there when the bread was being
  distributed. I came in afterwards. Both of these asser­tions have been made,
  and submitted to the men in whose hands my life rested, as evidence, made on
  oath, by these men—made solely and purely for the purpose of giving my body
  to an untimely grave. (The prisoner here, evidently to refresh his memory,
  looked at a little bit of paper in his hand, on which he had taken a few notes
  of the evidence during the trial.) There are many points, my lords, <span style="letter-spacing: -.1pt; mso-fareast-font-family: Times New Roman; mso-ansi-language: EN-US; mso-fareast-language: EN-US; mso-bidi-language: AR-SA">that

  it has been alleged I took part in. It is not my desire now, my lords, to give
  utterance to one word against the verdict which has been pronounced upon me.
  But fully conscious of my honor as a man, which has never been
  impugned—fully conscious that I can go into my grave with a name and
  character unsullied—I can only say this : that these parties, actuated by a
  desire either for their own aggrandizement, or to save their paltry, miserable
  lives, have pandered to the appetite, if I may so speak, of justice; and my
  life shall be the forfeit. Fully convinced and satisfied of the righteous­ness
  of my every act in connection with the late revolutionary move­ment in

  the other man, Corydon, I will make a few remarks. Perhaps before I go to
  Corydon, I should say, much has been spoken on that table of Colonel Kelly,
  and of the meeting held at his quarters or lodgings in London. I desire to
  state, I never knew where Colonel Kelly's lodgings were, and I never knew
  where he lived in London, until I heard the informer, Massey, announce it on
  the table. I never at-tended a meeting at Colonel Kellys, and the hundred
  other state­ments about him, that has been made to your lordships, and to
  you, gentlemen of the jury, I now solemnly declare, on my honor as a
  man—aye, as a dying man—these statements to have been totally unfounded
  and false from beginning to end. In relation to the small paper that was
  introduced here and brought against me, as evidence, as having been found on
  my person, in connection with that oath, I desire to say, that paper was not
  found on my person, and I knew no person whose name was on that paper.
  O'Byrne, of Dublin, or those other persons you have heard of, I never saw</span></font><span style="font-size:9.0pt;letter-spacing:-.1pt"><o:p>

  met. That paper has been put in there for some purpose. I can swear positively
  it was not in my hand writing ; I can also swear I never saw it, yet it is
  used as evidence against me. Is this justice ? Is this right ? Is this manly ?
  I am willing, if I have transgressed the laws, to suffer the punishment; but I
  object to this system of trumping up a case, to take away the life of a human
  being. True, I ask for no mercy. My present emaciated form—my constitution
  somewhat shattered—it is better that my life should<sub>,</sub> be brought
  to an end, than to drag out a miserable existe<sub>n</sub>ce in the prison
  pens of Portland. Thus it is, my lords, I accept the verdict. Of course my
  acceptance of it is unnecessary ; but I am satisfied with it. And now I shall
  close. True it is there are many feelings that actuate me at this moment. In
  fact, these few disconnected remarks can give no idea of what I desire to
  state to the court. I have ties to bind me to life and society, as strong as
  any man in this court. I have a family I love as much as any man in this court
  does his. But I can remember the blessing received from an aged mother's lips,
  as I left her the last time. She spoke as the Spartan mother did—&quot; Go,
  my boy. Return either with <b>your </b>shield or upon it.&quot; This
  reconciles me. This gives me heart. I submit to my doom, and I hope that God
  will forgive me my past sins. I hope, too, that inasmuch as He has for seven
  hundred years, preserved Ireland, notwithstanding all the tyranny to which she
  has been subjected, as a separate and distinct nationality, He will also
  retrieve her fallen fortunes—to rise in her beauty and her majesty, the
  sister of Columbia, the peer of any nation in the world.</font></span><span style="font-size:9.0pt;

I saw no change in Thomas Bourke the condemned and Thomas Bourke on trial.
Self-possessed and calm as ever, he spoke quietly, firmly and gently. His<b> </b>observations
were given almost invariably in reply. In the life of the informers he could see
noth­ing worth living for, when they had outlived their <span style="letter-spacing:-.05pt">honor
and foreswore their oaths ; so he gave his dictum,</span> and I believed him. I
spoke of his worn and enfeebled state of health, for I had special reasons for
so doing. He told me it was his souvenir of a gallant fight ; two bullet wounds
had passed through his leg near the upper thew of the thigh. The hospitals were
crowd­ed with wounded, and although he got as much `care as possible,<sup>'</sup>
still he was not so well cared as, ` under other circumstances he would be ;'
and the muscles of his leg sloughed away, until, he said, when the wound healed,
&quot; the skin alone covered the bone.&quot; And so, truly, it was; from his
thigh to about ten inches above the knee there was only the bone covered with
thin and seamed skin. There was one topic more upon which I started, and that
was the most import-ant topic—death was near him. I shall not tell how I
neared that great subject, but well I remember his reply. ` There is a little
book,' he said, ` which has taught me much, and one thing it has taught me
beyond all ; the longest life is not the best life. You read,' he said, ` the
Imitation of Christ,' An hour</font></p>
