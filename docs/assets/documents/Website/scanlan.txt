-To Mr. McDermott from Michael Scanlan-September 6, 1865
 
6 Sept 1865, [Printed heading] Head-quarters of the Fenian Brotherhood, State of Illinois, no. 17 South dark street, upstairs. Rooms i and 2, Chicago.
Asks McDermott to engage a private house in New York for Captain Quirk 'and his Will' during their forthcoming visit. They will leave Chicago on Friday night and arrive in New York on Sunday, probably at the Hudson River railway station ;
Colonel Quirk will know precisely and will tell McDermott. 'Do all you can for these gentlemen. They are the finest soldiers in the west'. The Scanlan girls to be informed that 'my wife and children will be in N.Y. in about 2 weeks and will stay with them for a couple of days'.
 

The other "Bold Fenian Men" was written mid 19C. by Michael Scanlan, about whom I came across the following (on his parish website!):
******************
Michael Scanlan was born in Castlemahon in 1833 and died in 1917. During the Great Famine, when Michael was fifteen years old, he left with his family for America. Scanlan worked in a number of different jobs in America before joining the State Department in Washington, where he became the Chief of the Bureau of Statistics.
Together with other Irish emigrants, he founded a paper called "The Irish Republic" in 1867. This paper was the mouthpiece of the Fenian organisation. Michael was a renowned writer and poet. He wrote the following poem, which Limerick historian Mainchín Seoighe described as 'the great anthem of the [Fenian] movement' in his book "County Limerick - its people and places".:
See who came over the red-blossomed heather,
Their green banners kissing the pure mountain air;
Heads erect, eyes to front, stepping proudly together,
Sure Freedom sits throned on each proud spirit there.
Down the hills twining
Their blessed steel shining.
Like rivers of beauty that flow from each glen,
From mountain and valley
Tis Liberty's rally -
Out and make way for the bold Fenian men!
