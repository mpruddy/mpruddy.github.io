<p align="center"><font size="6">Jeremiah O'Donovan Rossa</font></p>
<blockquote>
	<p align="justify"><font size="5">Jeremiah O'Donovan Rossa is a man who 
	needs a well-researched book written on him. He was a middle class Irishman 
	from Skibbereen, County Cork Ireland. He was interested in his Genealogy and 
	attached, after, we hope, sufficient investigation on the subject, &quot;Rossa&quot; 
	to end of his birth name. If one goes to the dictionary to look for &quot;loose 
	cannon&quot; a picture of&nbsp; O'Donovan Rossa should be lodged there. His 
	picture should also be in the definition of a Fenian. Rossa along with 
	Patrick Ford could be called the fathers of modern terrorism for inventing 
	the Skirmishing Fund which was set up to finance bombing missions to England 
	from America. Although called by many &quot;Jeremiah O'Dynamite Rossa&quot; in 
	actuality most of his peers describe him as a gentle man and not the 
	ferocious beast many English and American newspaper reporters wrote about in 
	the blaring headline style of the 1880s.</font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font size="5">Jeremiah O'Donovan Rossa and several others started&nbsp; the 
	Phenix club in the town of Skibbereen in County Cork in 1857: &quot;</font><span style="font-family: Times New Roman"><font size="5">a 
	society with a view to educate themselves and educate the country around 
	into national life and activity.&quot; This euphemistic statement means &quot;for 
	promoting Irish Nationalism.&quot; </font></span></p>
	<p align="justify"><font size="5">
	<span style="font-family: Times New Roman">Rossa was</span></font><span style="font-family: Times New Roman"><font size="5"> visited by James Stephens carrying an 
	introduction from John O'Mahony during Stephens' recruitment tour of Ireland 
	for the Irish Revolutionary Brotherhood (IRB) the Irish branch of Fenianism. 
	Almost everyone in the Phenix club joined the IRB. Rossa and his friends drilled 
	and trained in the mountains around his town. They were ultimately arrested 
	but later let go since there was no real evidence of his participation 
	except for a police informer (called &quot;approver&quot; by Rossa) named Daniel 
	Sullivan Goula who perjured himself giving false testimony. Rossa was re-arrested in September 1865 
	during the closing of the Fenian Dublin newspaper, the <i>Irish People</i>&nbsp; 
	for which he was the manager. His had job required him to tour Ireland collecting funds and inspecting IRB 
	circles for James Stephens.</font></span></p>
	<p align="justify"><font size="5">
	<span style="font-family: Times New Roman">He was in jail from 1865 to 1871 
	at which point he was released if he agreed not to live 
	on English soil. Rossa arrived in America in January of 1871 with John Devoy 
	[later chairman of the Clan na Gael] and several others who were known to 
	Irish American Nationalists as &quot;the exiles.&quot; He was a member of the 
	ill-fated Irish Confederation society which evolved from the Senate Wing of 
	the American Fenian Brotherhood and then disappeared for lack of support. 
	Rossa re-joined the O'Mahony-Savage Wing of the Fenian Brotherhood and also 
	joined the 
	Clan na Gael shortly after arriving in America in 1871-72. In 1877 Rossa was 
	elected president of the Fenaian Brotherhood.&nbsp; Rossa organized, along with Patrick Ford, editor of the Irish 
	World newspaper in New York in 1876 the &quot;Skirmishinng Fund&quot; by 
	collected subscriptions and posting the subscribers names in Ford's 
	newspaper. The object was to fund clandestine bombing operations in England. 
	When the Clan na Gael under John Devoy took over the fund and pushed Rossa to the side, 
	Rossa 
	attempted to set up his own society &quot;The United Irishman&quot; for which he was 
	ousted from the Clan na Gael. In 1885 Rossa in the The United Irishman 
	proclaimed that &quot;This dynamite work will go on till Ireland is free, or till 
	London is laid in ashes.&quot; And modern research indicates Rossa, using funds from his 
	newspaper also called the <i>United Irishman,</i> financed 
	several bombing forays into England. The Clan na Gael ousted John Devoy and 
	William Carroll and installed Michael Boland&nbsp; of Louisville and 
	Alexander Sullivan of Chicago who led the Clan na Gael in a bombing campaign 
	against English targets. Michael Boland later shown to be an English spy 
	insured the majority of the bombers were caught.</span></font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font size="5">
	<span style="font-family: Times New Roman">Rossa had a drinking problem 
	according to John Devoy who later wrote of him but perhaps the time spent in 
	prison explains his later life somewhat. Devoy was upset with him for his 
	United Irishman foray and for publicly advertising the Skirmishing Fund, but 
	they made up later. Devoy always took from his meager funds to care for 
	Rossa's family when Rossa was not able to. </span></font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font size="5">
	<span style="font-family: Times New Roman">This series of articles tells the 
	story of Fenianism from Rossa's perspective and was used as a base for 
	several books including &quot;Rossa's Recollections&quot; and &quot;Irish Rebels in English 
	Prisons&quot; </span></font></p>
