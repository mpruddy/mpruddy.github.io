<p><font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold">The unit has its origins in
&quot;Western&quot; clubs, firstly in the London area, and then
in South-western England. The founder members: Clive
&quot;Maverick&quot; Greene (Captain); Brian &amp; Stuart
&quot;Cas&quot; Woodhouse (father &amp; son); Dave
&quot;Drover&quot; Sewell; Harry &quot;H&quot; Peters and Dave
Burns were all &quot;cowboy&quot; re-enactors who discovered a
common interest in the American Civil War and formed the 4<sup>th</sup>
Michigan Volunteer Cavalry.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold">The unit is based at Tin
Park Stables, Cornwood, Devon - on the edge of Dartmoor which has
34,960 hectares (14,142 acres) of unclosed moorland on which to
ride, together with 849 km (540 miles) of access routes. The
riding is on rough terrain subject to extremes of weather.
Several owner- riders ride across the moor together most
weekends, sometimes to Princetown - dominated by the famous
Dartmoor prison. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold">Our training and drill is
based-on Cooke's (simplified) manual and a video provided by the
7<sup>th</sup> Michigan Cavalry - a US re-enactment unit.
Training events usually take-place on Dartmoor. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold">We are the sole providers
of cavalry for the American Civil War Society, the premier
re-enactment group in the UK: taking -part in most of their
events, including the biannual international event (1999 <i>et.
Seq</i>.) at Weston Park to which we get up to 50 riders,
including guests from the USA, France, Belgium, Germany and the
Netherlands (the infantry have had guests from as far as the
Czech Republic). Occasionally we &quot;galvanise&quot;, in full
or in part, to form Confederate cavalry when required.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold">&quot;Health &amp;
Safety&quot; is an important issue in the UK and we have had to
&quot;tighten-up&quot; on our procedures to meet legal
requirements, forming the 4<sup>th</sup> Michigan Volunteer
Cavalry Association to formalise the structure. The President of
the Association, Captain Greene is assisted by the Adjutant:
Brian &quot;5&quot; Rayden who, as a Senior Officer of H. M.
Customs &amp; Excise, is a qualified and legally appointed Health
&amp; Safety Representative for his union (&quot;PCS&quot;).
Detailed Health &amp; Safety procedures are now issued in the
Constitution, General Orders, and Health &amp; Safety Rules. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold">The 4<sup>th</sup> is
always looking for new recruits: Experienced cavalrymen
(especially from the USA) are welcome to join us as members or as
guests, but we also invite applications from experienced riders
who are not cavalry-trained: we will provide the cavalry training
and ensure their authenticity and safety before participation.
Exceptionally, we will take-on novice riders who are both
enthusiastic and keen to learn. </font></p>
