		<p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"><b><font size="4">IN his gentleness 
		and force, in his talents and devotion as a practical Catholic, in his 
		patriotism and purity, Charles J. Kickham bears a strong resemblance to 
		Richard D'Alton Williams, the poet, well and widely known by his nom de

		transactions in which Kickham was concerned have become a part of the 
		history of our day. For the facts embracing the earlier portion of his 
		career, we are indebted to one of his associates, Captain D. P. 
		Conyngham.* Charles J. Kickham was born about thirty-eight years ago, in 
		the small village of Mullinahone, which lies almost beneath the shelter 
		of Slievenamon, whose picturesque beauty he has interwoven into some of 
		his best poems. He sprang from a respectable and patriotic stock. His</font></b></p>

		<p class="MsoNormal" align="justify">&nbsp;</p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"><b><font size="4">father, John 
		Kickham, was a wealthy draper, and the leading man of the village, a 
		patriot and a philanthropist. He gave unto hundreds who were evicted 
		from their little farms, not only clothes from his store, but</font></b></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"><b><font size="4">I also money to 
		enable them to emigrate to America ; and to their credit be it said, 
		they gratefully returned it as soon as earned. Many a farmer, who to-day 
		enjoys peace and plenty in happy homesteads in America, blesses his 
		memory.</font></b></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"><b><font size="4">His mother was an 
		O'Mahony, and in every sense a lady, refined and charitable. Two of his 
		uncles and several of his relatives were eminent divines. Sprung from 
		such a family, and reared amid such associations, Charles Kickham grew 
		up with unsullied principles and a mind as pure as the gentlest maiden. 
		His father, a man of education, sound judgment and keen penetration, saw 
		that his son possessed the germs of a fine mind, and resolved to spare 
		no labor or expense to polish the diamond. He engaged a competent tutor 
		for that purpose. The boy progressed rapidly, but an unfortunate 
		occurrence blighted his hopes when about thirteen years of age : the 
		explosion of a powder flask brought the boy to the verge of the grave. 
		He slowly recovered, however, but remained deaf and near-sighted ever 
		after. He could not now avail him- self of the instructions of a 
		teacher, so he retired within himself, and became a great reader and 
		thinker. When only a boy of eighteen he contributed some beautiful 
		pieces to the press.</font></b></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"><b><font size="4">&quot;He was

		<p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"><b><font size="4">King's River, a 
		stream near his neighboring town, or wandering along the beautiful Anner, 
		that flows beside Slievenamon. At other times you might meet him with a 
		double-barreled gun in his hand, or flung on his shoulder, with Fan, the 
		terrier, and a pointer for his companions, wandering over the moors or 
		along the mountains, in search of game. He and his haunts were so well 
		known, that the little children crowded the cabin doors on the day he 
		was expected, looking out for Master Charles ; for he had a kind word 
		for all, and divided his spoils with them, and had shanachus with the 
		old women in the corner, and smoked the dudheen with the old man, and 
		talked of '98, of the Croppies and the Yeos, of the pitch-caps and the 
		triangles, of the wholesale exterminations and starvation of the 
		peasantry of the present time, until his honest blood coursed his veins 
		in fiery streams, and the tear moistened his eye, and the hope of 
		revenge gave a fierce expression to his kind and noble face. He 
		delighted very much in manly exercises, and keenly enjoyed the hurling 
		and the dance upon the green, and made these rural customs the subject 
		of some of his descriptive tales.&quot;</font></b></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"><b><font size="4">Though his 
		society was courted by the wealthiest, it was in the poor man's sheiling, 
		or enjoying the. merry dance and hurling-matches of the peasantry, he. 
		was most at home. The holiest peasant who mourned the wrongs of his 
		country and yearned for its freedom —who toiled hard for his daily 
		bread—was, in his opinion, far nobler than the sleek slave who, because 
		he had enough himself, closed his eyes to the sufferings around him, and 
		felt happy.</font></b></p>

		<p class="MsoNormal" align="justify">&nbsp;</p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"><b><font size="4">Although scarcely 
		twenty years of age in '48, he was an active rationalist, and in 
		conjunction with some congenial spirits organized a club in Mullinahone. 
		Having fallen under suspicion, he suffered some inconvenience for a 
		short time. He then returned to his old sports, and to literature, 
		writing fugitive pieces for the periodicals. Soon after Keogh and 
		Sadlier organized an independent opposition party—a Tenant-right 
		party—pledged to oppose every government that would not do justice to 
		Ireland, Keogh, in making his pledge, raised his hands and eyes to 
		Heaven, exclaiming—&quot; I pledge myself, so help me God!&quot; What became of 
		all these promises and violated oaths we know too well.</font></b></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"><b><font size="4">When the 
		treachery and rottenness of the Keogh and Sadlier party became apparent, 
		the Tipperary Leader became the great organ of the people in smashing up 
		their perjured clique; and Kickham, Father Kenyon and Fatter John Power 
		were among its ablest contributors.</font></b></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"><b><font size="4">Keogh became a 
		justice of the Common Pleas, and in time Kickham was arraigned as a 
		felon and a traitor before the perjured judge, who, if there was any 
		treason in the act which brought him there, was the man who taught him 
		that very treason.</font></b></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"><b><font size="4">Disgusted with 
		the treachery of his leaders, Kick- ham again retired within hi self--to 
		write tales and put the feelings of the people into vigorous verse. When 
		Doctor Cane of Kilkenny started the Celt, Kirkham at once became a 
		contributor, writing sketches, tales, essays, and poems. Of the latter,

		<p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"><b><font size="4">&quot;Rory of the Hill 
		&quot; appeared in this periodical. Although Kickham had vowed to eschew 
		politics in future, he became a convert to Stephens' views ; and when 
		John. O'Mahony visited Ireland he initiated one man, and that was our 
		poet, who at once threw himself with the devotion of his nature into the 
		organization, and was mainly instrumental in sowing the seeds of 
		Fenianism over Tipperary. He paid a visit to the United States in 1863, 
		and was present at the First National Congress of the Brotherhood at 
		Chicago. On his return home he became a leading writer for the Irish, 
		People; and on Stephens' visit to America during the war, he was 
		designated (without his knowledge) one of the three executive council to 
		manage&nbsp; affairs in his absence. Kickham was captured at the time of 
		Stephens' arrest, and brought to trial in Dublin at the re-sitting of 
		the Special Commission, 5th January, 1867. At its commencement, his 
		defence was conducted by counsel ; but on the refusal, by the judges, of 
		his application to have Thomas Clarke Luby produced as a witness, he 
		declared the trial was a mockery, and refused to have any further legal 
		assistance. He addressed the jury in his own defence, and made a lengthy 
		and clever speech, one which bore the impress, not only of talent, but 
		of truthfulness in every part, and which certainly tended to place his 
		conduct in a more innocent light than that in which it was represented 
		by the Crown lawyers.</font></b></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"><b><font size="4">He said that a 
		person unaccustomed as he was to public speak ing, could hardly get out 
		his ideas at all without preparation, and he had had no time. However, 
		he had no objection to go on.</font></b></p>

		<p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"><b><font size="4">No prisoner had 
		ever been treated more unfairly than he was. ,,Not only had he to bear 
		his share of calumny, but from the commencement of the Commission, in 
		every speech made by counsel for the Crown, his name was dragged in, and 
		not alone that, but even the judges on the bench did it. He could not 
		but feel a little surprised when one of the judges read out the names 
		from the &quot;Executive document &quot;—Luby, O'Leary, and Kickham--and said he 
		shuddered at the crimes these men would commit if they had the power. He 
		could not help thinking that his lordship should have recollected that 
		them was one of these men who was not yet tried, and who might be 
		innocent of even knowing the existence of this document. So that he 
		(prisoner) considered he had been tried and found guilty five times in 
		that Court House, and he did not know how many times in Cork. He would 
		now go through the articles in the indictment, but would not read them 
		all. The first article was one headed &quot;'82 and '29.&quot; If they took the 
		trouble of reading through that article, they would be at a loss to see 
		why it was that so long an article, with so little treason in it, should 
		have the place of honor. They might not agree with the writer, but it 
		was, nevertheless, true what he said, that it would have been well for 
		Ireland that the claims of the loyal Volunteers of '82 had been refused, 
		for the result would have been complete</font></b></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"><b><font size="4">&nbsp;independence. 
		And let them look back upon the history of this country—not a gleam of 
		sunshine—the sufferings of the people, and the exodus. What Irishman 
		could look upon the eighty-four years which had passed and would not 
		say, &quot; Give us our country for ourselves, and, in God's name, let us see 
		what we can do with it.&quot; These armed volunteers trampled on the 
		Treason-Felony Act. So much for '82. There was not much treason in that. 
		Perhaps it was in the '29 part of the article the treason was. The 
		purport of that portion was, that if the English Government refused 
		emancipation, he Roman Catholics would have taken up arms, and that the 
		If eral Protestants would have joined them. The Duke of Wellington said 
		the same thing, and he must say that a bishop in America was so 
		oblivious of his allegiance as to organize forty thousand armed Fenians, 
		to send them to Ireland, if the Government refused emancipation. There 
		was one good thing</font></b></p>

		<p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"><b><font size="4">&nbsp;</font></b></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"><b><font size="4">that the Fenians 
		did. He said that concessions to Ireland had been always the result of 
		Fenianism in some shape or other ; the English Government, however, 
		while making concessions, always expected to get something in return ; 
		and, he believed, they had never been disappointed. Not only had they 
		stipulated upon getting prompt payment, but, also, they got a large 
		instalment in advance. And here he could not help referring to the 
		publication of Sir John Gray's affidavit, which he stated he withheld, 
		afraid it would injure the prisoners on their trial, and yet that very 
		affidavit was published on the eve of his trial. To return to the 
		article &quot; '82 and '29,&quot; he repeated, they would find very little treason 
		in it. Why, then, had it been placed on the front of the indictment? 
		That was done for a passage in it referring to Roman Catholic judges, 
		and Roman Catholic placemen, in which it was said, &quot;The Catholic judge 
		will prove as iniquitous a tool of tyranny, as the most bigotted Orange 
		partisan would be.&quot; It would not do for the Attorney-General to select 
		articles in which one of the judges was mentioned by name in the 
		severest language. That would be going too far. Judge Keogh said he had 
		never seen a copy of the Irish People, and he believed that if his 
		lordship had seen these articles, he would have tried to avoid sitting 
		in judgment on the men who were accused of being the writers of them.</font></b></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"><b><font size="4">But the 
		Attorney-General knew of them, and he believed that the articles he 
		alluded to had been placed in the front for the purpose of prejudicing 
		Roman Catholic judges against the prisoners they would have to try ; and 
		the Special Commission was appointed—if that was the word—for the sole 
		purpose of enabling them to select the judges, and that it was the best 
		mode of following up the attempt to put down the organization, by 
		trampling on the law, and then following that up by trampling on the law 
		of morality and decency. If it were necessary to interrupt him, Mr. 
		Lawless would communicate their lordships' wishes to him.</font></b></p>

		<p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"><b><font size="4">The Prisoner went

		a number of military books, such as those found in the office of the 
		Irish People, and he would say, `These are what Irishmen want—this is 
		what they should learn.' His statue, by Hogan, is now in Mount Jerome. 
		The whole nation mourned his death, and all creeds and classes gathered 
		round his grave': Thomas Davis saw the peasants' cabins pulled down by
