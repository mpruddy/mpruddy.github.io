<p align="justify"><b>JOHN FLOOD, who was arrested with McCafferty in the Liffey 
under the name of Phillips, and who was so constantly alluded to by the informer 
and detectives, presented a striking appearance when confronted with his 
persecutors. A fine looking man, of large person, and frank, handsome features, 
adorned by an ample beard of a tawny color, his bearing was upriglt and 
stalwart, and he seemed little affected by the confinement of prison life. John 
Flood is about thirty years of age, and a Wexford. man. He first became 
specially distinguished by his participation in the arrangements for the escape 
of Stephens from Ireland. He accompanied Stephens and Colonel Kelly in their 
perilous journey from Dublin to Scotland. Adverse winds blew their boat into 
Belfast Harbor with the loss of their tiller ; and. it was owing to Flood's 
knowledge and experience that the party were saved. He received a severe injury 
in the hand letting go the an-</b></p>

chor in the hurry to prevent their being driven too far into the harbor. Flood 
saw Stephens safe to Paris, and after a few days returned to Ireland, and almost 
immediately took his position as one of the first officers of the English and 
Scotch Organization. He is frequently alluded to as one of the &quot; Directory &quot; and 
as chief projector of the Chester affair. His comrades speak of him as a man of 
great energy, who always stood faithfully to his work, and was respected and 
relied upon by the people.<br>
It will be remembered that Edward Duffy was one of the parties arrested at 
Stephens' house on the morning of the 11th November, 1865. He was charged at the 
same time with confederating and conspiring to levy war against the Queen, to 
separate Ireland from England, and to establish a republic in the former. On 
this occasion, before the magistrates, Mr. Duffy sharply catechised the police, 
and denied the right of the latter to search suspected localities without a 
warrant. He wanted to expose the fact that &quot; according to British law, a 
constable can arrest a man for treason without a warrant&quot; in Ireland. The chief 
police magistrate declined to discuss the point, and Duffy called on the members 
of the press who were present to note the fact, &quot;in order,&quot; as he said, &quot; that 
the public may know under what sort of law we are living.&quot; Mr. Duffy was 
committed,' with his friends, Stephens, Kickham, and Brophy, to Richmond jail.<br>
Mr. Edward Duffy was regarded as a person of more than usual influence in the 
organization—a man<br>
<br>

of capacity, ability and resolution, who stood high in the estimation of the 
then controlling powers of the Brotherhood. While in prison, however, grave 
symptoms of disease manifested themselves, which threatened to end in consigning 
Mr. Duffy to a premature grave. The authorities, seeing his health such as would 
prevent any future aid to the cause for which he was arrested, set him at 
liberty. He went to the west of Ireland, and, in company with a young man named 
Thomas Egan, was again arrested at Boyle in the County of Roscommon, on the 11th 
of March, 1866. The prisoners were immediately conveyed to Dublin ; and on the 
trial of Captain McCafferty, while the informer Corydon was being examined, Mr. 
Duffy was brought forward for identification with John Flood. Duffy was 
characterized as &quot; the organizer for the province of Connaught.&quot; They were 
subsequently brought to trial at the Special Commission, Dublin; and on Friday, 
17th May, Flood, Duffy, and Michael Cody, (who attempted to shoot his captors,) 
were found guilty of treason-felony. It will be remembered that Flood and 
McCafferty were arrested on the 23d February, after having eluded the 
authorities from the day of the Chester demonstration ; and it was sought to 
directly connect them with the rising of the 5th March. An authoritative 
communication to the Dublin Irishman contradicts this, and we are in a position 
to know that the statement which follows is based on fact<br>
&quot; Of course anything that I can say now cannot alter the sen- tence of the law, 
nor be of any benefit to the prisoner; yet it is</b></p>
<p align="justify"><br>
<b>FLOOD, DUFFY, AND CODY. 377</b></p>
<p align="justify"><br>
<b>due to history that the truth should be known. The Directory, of which it was 
supposed that Flood and McCafferty were members, had been dissolved long before 
they came to Ireland. The rising of the 5th was planned by other parties, and 
long after Flood and McCafferty were arrested, All this Massey could have told 
were he allowed to give evidence on the trial of either. The paper so cleverly 
&quot;burked &quot; by the Crown, would also prove that these two men had nothing whatever 
to do with the rising, nor did they even know of that event. It is plain that 
the Crown lawyers kept Massey and his informations back for the purpose of 
having Flood and McCafferty convicted. They knew that the production of either 
on the, trial would infallibly acquit them. How will an astonished world look 
upon the English Government when that paper, in the keeping of the Chief 
Secretary, shall see the light and confirm my statement, that these men are 
innocent ?<br>
On Tuesday, the 21st May, Flood, Duffy, and Cody were brought up for sentence. 
In reply to the usual question, Flood stood forward, and in a strong, clear 
voice and pleasant utterance, said<br>
My lords—&quot; I have been convicted on the evidence of three men. Not one word of 
truth has either of them sworn. To begin with Corydon. I will say that I was not 
present at the meeting he describes as having taken place in Liverpool. 1 knew 
nothing about it, and I believe that the Crown counsel have had in their hands 
the means of disproving what he said. I believe that Massey 's evidence would go 
to disprove it, and in fact, there never was a Directory of which I was a 
member. The Crown had that evidence in their hands and would not produce it. I 
was not in that place in Chester where Bray says I was. Every word he swore 
concerning me was a falsehood from beginning to end. I may say that a detective 
officer went over to Manchester, but the Attorney-General denied it, to tamper 
with a witness. If the detective went to Manchester and sought to know whether 
these people told the truth or not, he must have satisfied himself that </b></p>
<p align="justify"><b>378&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; FENIAN 
HEROES AND MARTYRS,</b></p>
<p align="justify"><b><br>
they did tell the truth, and that I was in Manchester at the time.<br>
<br>
Therefore, I say, the Crown held possession of evidence, which they withheld, to 
prove that I was not at Chester at the time the swore I was. I positively 
declare that the detective never saw me there, for I was not there. Now the 
evidence of Dawson, that very effective detective, bears falsehood on the face 
of it. He swears he saw me, and knew my appearance, about town for a length of 
time, and met me in Burke's public house, where I never was in my life. A 
strange coincidence is that on that night he saw me enter a drill-room. Can any 
one believe that that is true? Now I say I have been unfairly dealt with other- 
wise, and I say that, by a sort of legal legerdemain, I have been placed on 
trial here on the terrible charge of assassination. No man in this court could 
regard such a charge with greater horror than I do. No man has a greater horror 
of it, and I never heard of such an odious and abominable conspiracy as the 
witness Meara had deposed to. I am sure that no true Irishman would attempt to 
have anything to do with such a thing. I heard nothing about it, and I do say 
that, if I should have been tried with ay one, I should have been tried with 
McCafferty, the man with<br>
whom I was identified, and with whom I was arrested, I might w <br>
have got a fair trial then, but I declare I have not had a fair trial. There has 
been an extreme course adopted by the Crown toward me from my arrest to the 
present hour. I say they had evidence in their possession which would have gone 
to prove my innocence, and it has been suppressed. Let them deny that. The 
Attorney- General says he thinks he is above motives. I impute no motives. I 
state facts and leave the world to judge. You saw how the identification has 
been proved against me by that woman from Chester. I will tell you how such a 
thing is carried on. We were taken to Mountjoy and paraded before the Detective 
Police, and day after day came groups of people either informers or detectives 
from England or elsewhere, always accompanied by one or more of the detectives 
who came there the day before; and I do not know but these people were told, 
That's Flood,' or That's McCafferty.' If they had come forward and identified me 
properly, they should have said, You arc the man I saw in Chester, or 
Liverpool,' as</b></p>
<p align="justify"><b><br>
FLOOD, DUFFY, AND CODY.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 379</b></p>
<p align="justify"><b><br>
the case may be. I repeat again that I have been unfairly dealt with in every 
sense of the word. The Attorney -General has alluded to me repeatedly as that 
wretched man. If loving my country through my whole life should make me 
wretched, I am wretched indeed; for I tell you now, and I tell the world, that I 
not only abhor assassination, but that I would rather go to my doom than be 
guilty of the moral assassination that has been practiced against me. I am 
ready, my lords, for my sentence.&quot;<br>
The usual question was then put to Duffy, who stepped forward, and despite the 
miserably weak state to which illness had reduced ham, spoke as follows, clearly 
•and distinctly, but evidently with much difficulty.<br>
My Lords—&quot; I am not in a capacity to say much to your lordships, after the 
evidence of that man Kelly against me. He has sworn falsely against me. I leave 
my countrymen to judge. There is no political act of mine which I regret. I 
joined the association sincerely, for my country's cause, and I have been 
actuated throughout by a strong sense of duty. I believe that a man's duty to 
his country is part of his duty to God, for it is He that, in fact, implants the 
feeling of patriotism in the human breast, and who knows whether I have been 
actuated by any paltry ambition, and whether I have worked for any selfish ends. 
For the late outbreak I am not responsible. I did all in my power to prevent it, 
knowing that, circumstanced as we were, it would be a failure. I feel bound, in 
justice to myself, to say this. It had been stated on the trials that Stephens 
was for peace. That was a mistake, and it maybe well that it should not be left 
uncontradicted. It is but too well known in Ireland that he sent numbers of men 
here to fight, promising them to be with them when the time would come. The time 
did come, but not Mr. Stephens. He remained behind. He went to France to see the 
Paris Exhibition. It may be a very pleasant sight, but I would not be in his 
place now. He is a lost man—lost to Ireland, lost to his country. There are a<br>

<p align="justify"><b><br>
few things that I would wish to say relative to the evidence given on my trial, 
but I request, my lord, that you would give me per- mission to make those 
remarks after sentence has been passed. They solely and entirely relate to the 
evidence, and I have a reason for asking why I should be allowed to say them 
after sentence has been passed.&quot;<br>
The Chief Justice—&quot; That is not the usual practice. The fact of your not having 
been tried for your life makes it very doubtful to me whether you should speak 
at all as to why sentence should not be passed upon you.&quot;<br>
The prisoner—&quot; With regard to the first piece of evidence, I declare before my 
God, that not one word that man swore against me on the table was true. He swore 
he saw me at Enniskerry ; but I never spoke to him on any political subject, or 
that I ever knew him to be an important member of the association until I saw 
the informations, I declare to Heaven I never did. He never spoke to me in my 
life, I knew him from the time he was a child, and I knew him to be among the 
vilest and worst in that little town, and I knew the character he was. Is it to 
be supposed that I would put my liberty into the hands of such a character ?&nbsp;&nbsp; 
I never did. The next witness is Cordon. He swore that at the meeting to which 
he referred, I gave him directions to go to Kerry to O'Connor, and put himself 
in communication with them. I declare to my God that every word of that is 
false. Whether O'Connor was in the country or whether he made his escape, I knew 
as little as your lordship, and never heard of the Kerry rising till the tale of 
it appeared in the public papers. There is not a word of that that is not false. 
And as to giving the American officers information, before my God, and on the 
verge of my grave, as the sentence will send me to it, I say that is also false. 
As to the writing the policeman swore to in that book, and which is not a prayer 
book—it is an 'Imitation of Christ given to me,' by a lady to whom I served my 
time—what was written in that book was written by another young man who was in 
her employment. That is his and not my writing. That is the writing of a young 
man in the house, and I never wrote a line or a word of it.&quot; <br>
The Lord Chief Justice—&quot; It was not sworn to be in your hand-writing, as I 
understand.&quot;<br>
Prisoner—&quot; Yes, my lord. It was the policeman that swore it was in my 
handwriting.&quot;<br>
The Lord Chief Justice—&quot;That is a mistake. It was said to be like yours, but it 
was not given in evidence against you.&quot;<br>
Prisoner—&quot;It was said to be my writing. The jury have doomed me to a painful, 
but not less glorious death. I bid fare- well to my friends and all who are dear 
to me. There is yet a world where souls are free, and in that world I would 
sooner be than live in a life like this. I am proud to be considered worthy of 
suffering for my country, and when I am in my lonely cell, during the longings 
of my weary spirit, I shall not forget Ireland, and my constant prayer shall be 
that the God of Liberty may give her time and strength to shake off her chains.( 
Addressing the reporters)—I would not wish it to be supposed that it was on ac- 
count of my position now that I spoke as I did. I am not able to speak on 
account of my disease, and I do not wish it said that it was on account of my 
position. It is on account of my illness.&quot;<br>
Michael Cody was regarded 'as a very dangerous character, and the names of the 
judges, prosecuting counsel, and jurors who tried Bourke and Doran having been 
found upon him, gave a pretext to the au- thorities to extend unusual severity 
to him. When his turn came to address the court, he said :<br>
&quot;As to the evidence of Foley, there are two men prepared to say he never saw me 
until he was brought to Kilmainham. Meagher says he met me in company with 
Baines, in the Canal Tavern, with a parcel of bowie-knives. This, also, is false 
, for I never had a bowie-knife in my possession, but one which was found in my 
possession in Lesson Lane. As to my acquaintance with St. Clair, Devoy, and 
others, I feel proud to be acquainted with them. From the moment I became 
sensible of my arrest,<br>
&nbsp;</b></p>
<p align="justify"><b>382 FENIAN HEROES AND MARTYRS.</b></p>
<p align="justify"><br>
<b>I was fully confident that a case would be trumped up against me, and I am 
not disappointed with the verdict. As to Corydon, he also swears that he knew me 
in 1865, and that I filled the position of centre, military organizer, 
detective, and Chief of the Assassination Committee, I am not so presumptuous as 
to imagine myself competent to fill any one of them ; but in justice to my own 
character, and in justice to the character of the men who are in the dungeons of 
Portland, I think I have a right to say that that charge is altogether 
unfounded. I am now about to be deprived of my liberty, perhaps for life, and I 
would scorn to say what is false, even to get out of this dock ; and before God 
and this assembly I say that the charge against me of being connected with that 
assassination committee, is as false as God is true. I have nothing more to 
say.&quot;<br>
Mr. Baron Deasy then proceeded to pass sentence. In the course of his 
observations, he fully exonerated. Flood and Duffy from any connection with the 
assassination plan referred to by Corydon, and sentenced them to Fifteen Years' 
Penal Servitude each. The &quot; evidence &quot; produced against Cody on his trial, and 
the circumstance of his previous arrest, &quot; compelled the Court &quot; to give him 
Twenty years.<br>
After the sentence had been pronounced, the convicts were removed from the cells 
beneath the court and conveyed to Mountjoy prison, escorted by mounted police, 
and two troops of the Ninth Lancers.<br>
