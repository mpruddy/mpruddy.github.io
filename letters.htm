        <td><strong>Ovid, August 7, 1862<br>
        Dear friend Albert<br>
        Yours came to hand yesterday<br>
        <br>
        I am glad you enlisted when you did, it is all excitement
        here. Every man that is between 18 &amp; 45 years of age
        is sick or going to be, or lost a finger, or a thumb, or
        a great toe. Any thing for an excuse.<br>
        One man has been down to get the Town Board together to
        appoint him Constable so he could stay at home. Another
        man has offered $200.00 for a substitute if he is
        drafted. Another man came 6 miles to tell us that he
        expected to have the palsy before another winter. It is
        really laughable.</strong><p><strong>This morning
        McIntyre, Knowles, Lounsbury, &amp; Smith have gone.
        Fishbeck and a number of others are still coming. Charles
        Herdon has enlisted and a good many more from Duplain
        will enlist in a few days. The first call for 300,000,
        our quota will be filled this week. Next comes 300,000
        more 9 months min. I think we are beginning to awake to
        the subject. It is time we have something to do to crush
        this rebellion &amp; the sooner we go at it the better by
        far to do what we have to do. </strong></p>
        <p><strong>I read a letter from brother John yesterday.
        They are having warm times there. Rubi wrote yesterday
        that he started with his regiment in two weeks. I do not
        know what regiment it is. Gustav is in 2nd with Barber.
        He is tryingto get a discharge. Rubi thinks she will come
        here this fall. It is lonely enough here. Take good care
        of yourself. We will try to keep everything straight
        here. I should not be surprised if George Shepard, Binck
        &amp; Button enlisted. <br>
        I will not write anymore this time all well<br>
        Yours respectfully<br>

        August 14th 1862<br>
        <br>
        Dear John and Mary<br>
        We are having a rainy day in camp, nothing much to do, a
        line to you will probably be acceptable. We have been in
        camp now since last Tuesday. I have never felt better in
        my life than I do now. None of us have been sick except
        Frank Aldrich and Norman Smith and they are better. There
        are now five companies on the ground. They are full, I
        believe. Captain Wells, McFarlan, Fulton, Robbins and
        Shepard. Captain Horace Gray was our captain when we came
        here and Sherpard 1st LT. but Gray has a major's
        Commission now which makes Shepard our Captain. Captain
        Carter 1st LT, Hudson 2nd LT (brevet LT not appointed
        yet) I have the appointment as First Orderly Sergeant,
        which will be permanent, I think if I give satisfaction.
        John Gilbert is 2nd Duty Sergeant. I have been left in
        command nearly all the time. Shepard and Carter are down
        town busy making out the paper for mustering, and the
        bounty money. I keep the roll book. We have two roll
        calls, one at 5 o'clock am and at Retreat or Sundown.
        When we get organized we will have three. I give all
        passes from the camp, detail men for guard-mounting,
        march them to the guard house and deliver them to the
        Sergeant of the Guard and have to look after things in
        general. It keeps me busy all the time, but I don't mind
        that if I can only keep well. We have passed examination.
        </strong><p><strong>All of the Ovid boys were all right.
        We expect to be mustered in this week, but there is no
        certainty. I hope we will get to drilling soon. Colonel
        Minty was in camp yesterday. He is a pleasant looking man
        and well-liked by everyone. Our camp is 1 3/4 miles from
        the city, up the river opposite the barracks, and
        adjoining the cememtery on the west. A very pleasant
        situation -- have a view of the city, we can see the
        boats pass up and down the river. Elmwood Cemetery is a
        splendid place, there are monuments there that cost from
        $1000.00 to $3000.00 I should judge, some are 25 ft.
        high. The grounds are kept in good order. Gravelled
        roads, flower-beds and 2 fountains which are playing all
        the time. At the entrance there is a green-house with an
        artificial rock, flight of stairs and a grotto with vines
        clambering round it. I can't tell you anything about it
        only it is very nice. </strong></p>
        <p><strong>Six Sibley tents are allowed to each Company,
        besides a square tent for the Capt and Lt each. Not a
        drop of rain can get in , we have plenty of hay and have
        drawn our blankets so we can sleep in the hay. I have
        never slept better than since I have been here, the tents
        are pitched in the streets, we are on Clinton Avenue,
        Ovid<br>
        Block no.3. I have bought me a cap downtown. The caps
        allowed us are poor things. We are credited with all the
        articles which we do not draw, at a government price. We
        have not got our uniforms yet, all of us. 25 have been
        issued to us, we let those have them that needed them
        worst. I shall not be home until I get my uniform and
        bounty money, and get mustered in, can't tell how soon
        that may be, probably two weeks yet,- We are allowed a
        plate, cup, knife, fork, &amp; spoon. I raised a dollar
        yesterday, sent out and got some lumber and now we have
        tables to eat on, and we have plenty to eat, too -- bread
        , pork or bacon, fresh beef twice a week, beans, rice,
        onions, beets, cabbage, coffee, tea, sugar. No need of
        grumbling on that score. </strong></p>
        <p><strong>There was a fire about 1/2 mile from camp day
        before yesterday, a saw-mill burned -- it made an awful
        blaze. Estimated loss $70,000.00 -- thousands of feet of
        lumber were burnt -- riches take wings and fly away.
        Yesterday there were 3 fires brought out in the city, but
        the engines were on hand and put them out, -- no doubt
        the work of an incendiary...</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Your letters just came to hand. I was glad to
        hear from you that you are well. I won't write any more
        now. Give my love to all, show this to Father if you see
        him. Mary your needles and pins have come in good play --
        thank you. There are 98 in company now. <br>
        Write soon.<br>

        Camp near Crab Orchard<br>
        Dear Father, Mother, and Sister<br>
        We are in camp near a village named Crab Orchard. We
        received marching orders last Friday the 10th at
        Jeffersonville Indiana. Started from there about noon.
        Crossed the Ohio for the first time into KY. Only part of
        the regiment was ready, six companies. Louisville is a
        handsome city, larger than Detroit. It was rather
        disagreeable marching the roads were very dusty. The
        roads in KY are excellent. We took the road for
        Bardstown. Put up in the woods the first night. I have
        kept a kind of a memorandum every day since we&#146;ve
        commenced this march. I will copy a day or two.<br>
        *********************<br>
        Friday Oct 11th <br>
        The clouds of threatening rain gave us a little shower
        last night, just enough to lay the dust. Passed quite a
        number of Sesesh prisoners that have been paroled. They
        are as dirty ragged set as ever I seen. Their<br>
        clothes are just the color of the ground. They look half
        starved. I talked with one who was taken prisoner at the
        battle of Perryville. He belonged to the 25th Louisiana.
        Was under Gen Bragg. He said Bragg was not liked by his
        men and ought to have been in h&#151;l long ago. Said he
        lied to them so often that they did not believe anything
        he said. Said they were 3/4 Union men in the county where
        he lived but they were impressed in the Service against
        their will. I asked him if he thought if they would come
        out ahead. He said they were bound to keep trying. He
        thought they were [in the] right. I asked if he would
        fight against us after he was exchanged. He said he knew
        they would call for him but &quot;he wouldn&#146;t be
        there.&quot; He said the majority of the men were tired
        of the war and would be glad to come back in the Union
        again but the leaders were not. <br>
        Reached Bardstown about 3 pm, quite a pretty village.
        Passed 4 hearses on their way to Louisville from the
        battlefield of Perryville. 3 Generals and a colonel were
        in them. Major Genl Jackson, Genl Tesril? &amp; Col
        Hewitt? were all the names I learned &#150; rather gloomy
        picture. The road is filled with army wagons and trains
        of 100 to 200 wagons are constantly passing to &amp; fro.
        Put up about 5 miles beyond Bardstown. </strong><p><strong>Sunday
        Oct 12th<br>
        Passed the battle field at Perryville. Saw a number of
        dead Sesesh on the field. One lay close by the side of
        the road. He was shot through the breast &#150; his
        pockets inside out, boots stolen. He had lain there since
        Wednesday. About a dozen lay upon the hillside. We were
        told that about 2500 were piled up in a valley out of
        sight &amp; that the rebels burned 30 or 40 the night
        after the battle. They take every means to conceal the
        real<br>
        number they lose in a battle. This is a hard picture, a
        war picture, such as I had read about but never seen
        before. My thoughts were rather serious. </strong></p>
        <p><strong>Put up at Danville. Carter, Shepard and myself
        went in a Union man&#146;s house &amp; got an excellent
        supper. He was well informed &amp; flowing over with
        hospitality. Two little wenches with white aprons stood
        behind their mistress to pass the coffee &amp; hoe cakes.</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Monday Oct 13th<br>
        Nothing of importance today. We march by fours. I am
        chief of the third platoon. Our horses are getting tired
        out. My horses back is quite sore and I don&#146;t feel
        first rate myself. </strong></p>
        <p><strong>Tuesday Oct 14th<br>
        The bugle sounded at one o&#146;clock this morning and we
        were soon in our saddles on the road after the rebels.
        They have been retreating since the battle. The last of
        them passed thro Danville on Saturday, I believe. We
        passed the outposts of our forces about 3 o&#146;clock, a
        little after daylight our skirmishers drove in their
        picketts (a regiment of Ohio cavalry ahead of us) Major
        Parks called it quite a heavy skirmish. We formed under
        the brow of a hill expecting every minute to hear a cry
        of &#145;charge&#146;, but did not. They sent some shell
        among us but none hit. One shell passed about 20 ft over
        our heads and plowed a hole in a bank in the rear of us.
        Luckily it did not explode or perhaps I would not have
        been writing this. A rebel Lieutenant Colonel was shot
        instantly by one of the Ohio boys. I don&#146;t know
        whether he is alive yet or not, only one of our men was
        wounded, an Ohio boy, shot in the arm.<br>
        *********************<br>
        Bragg is trying his biggest to get out of the State. That
        is now his object. I don&#146;t think we will have a
        battle until we get to Cumberland Gap which is in the
        South East corner of KY. That is where he is marching for
        now. The skirmish we had Tuesday morning was only with
        the rear guard of his Army. He is said to have over 100
        thousand men. I think perhaps he has. Buell&#146;s army
        is 150,000 strong divided into three divisions of 50,000
        apiece. I understand Wallace&#146;s Division is at
        Cumberland Gap waiting for re-enforcements whether so or
        not I cannot tell. I hope it will prove true. If we can
        get there before Bragg I think he will be taken with his
        army, if he succeeds in getting thro into Tennessee or
        Virginia he will make a great deal of trouble yet. The
        Federals have been chasing him thro Mississippi,
        Tennessee, up to Louisville and so far back, and have not
        caught him yet. He is like the paddy&#146;s flea&#133;.</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Suppose we talk about something else. I have
        seen soldiers, cavalry, infantry until it is no sight at
        all. We soon get used to these things and to hardships.
        I&#146;ve have had hard crackers and bacon since we
        commenced marching, and that is all &#150; pretty hard
        fare, I have felt well enough until the last two days.
        Yesterday morning I was quite sick. It was a bilious turn
        just the same as I have at home. The hard food and
        marching was a little too much for me. I did not ride my
        horse, yesterday but laid in an ambulance. Dr Bacon, our
        assistant surgeon is a very fine man. I feel a great deal
        better today. I am taking Swiss? Powders and quinine.
        Today we are lying still waiting for the rest of the
        regiment to come up &amp; I am very glad. I shall keep
        still a day or two &amp; then I will be all right again.
        You know I promised to write if I was sick. I might very
        easily have kept this to myself. John Gilbert had the
        ague last night, he is writing home today. We are writing
        under an Oak tree on a hill. Newman, Lounsbury, &amp;
        Nestrin? Knowles are also writing. Those likenesses that
        I wrote about sending home have not come. The trunk was
        not sent. I will get them back again when our baggage
        wagons come. </strong></p>
        <p><strong>You must have hard work to read this letter ,
        I did not think of writing much when I commenced but kept
        writing just as thoughts came to me. See what a mixed up
        mess it is. And I have half done yet. Colonel Minty sent
        out Lieutenant Carter &amp; 20 men foraging last night.
        They brought us in 8 sheep this morning. The boys drove
        about 20 pigs a yard and delivered them to the
        commissary. 3 men have passed me while I have been
        writing one had 4 turkeys, one had 2 turkeys &amp; 3
        chickens, the other had some geese. If we stay here a day
        or two eggs will be very high here next season I fear.
        Colonel Minty asked very innocently of the cook this
        morning where he got that mutton. Cook said he
        didn&#146;t know. Twas brought there last night. The
        colonel thought it was very singular . The colonel allows
        the men to get supplies. He keeps an account of it so
        that if necessary he can sign receipts for the same, if
        they belong to a union man and he makes complaint. He get
        a paper to show the facts and the government pays him for
        all that is taken. If it belongs to a rebel he will
        probably not make a complaint, for we should nab him. The
        colonel knows that if he did not allow the men to get
        forage in this way, that they would get it on their own
        hook and he takes a wise course. The country through here
        is very hilly. All that we have marched over is rolling.
        Some places very rocky just fit for cattle &amp; sheep
        &amp; nothing else. Around Perryville the country is all
        laid waste. Fences torn down. Cornfields destroyed. I
        never saw so desolate a place. Every house for 2 miles is
        a Hospital. I tried to get supper at Perryville. Could
        not get a<br>
        mouthfull. The rebels had impressed their flour mills.
        They could not get meal nor flour only as they pounded it
        up as used N---? F---? the water is poor, so many
        thousand passing through dries up the springs. All we get
        is<br>
        muddy &amp; brackish. I have wished many times I could
        have one good sip out of the spring at home. </strong></p>
        <p><strong>I have not got a word from you since I left
        Detroit. I have written this makes three times. Mail is
        very irregular. Direct to Company B. Fourth Michigan
        Cavalry near Louisville KY and I guess it will come
        through. Send the Tribune or Free Press every chance you
        get. A paper here is a rarity. You must excuse me to Wm
        Shepard, Elder Bassett and George Binck I promised to
        write to them but I do not have time nor place. If we
        ever get settled in quarters then I will have more time.
        But now I can&#146;t. Give my love to Nancy, Faxon &amp;
        Family. I will write them as soon as I can. To uncle Em
        &amp; aunt Phebe, John and Mary. Let George Binck read
        this if he can and Mary Longor. Give my love to all of

        I will write you a line this morning. As I have time. I

        is nothing but biliousness humor. I am about well now, Dr
        Bacon of Dewitt, Clinton county is the Asst Surgeon and a
        very fine man. We are in a Presbyterian Church in New
        Market, a dirty little village among the hills. There is
        about 30 sick now, none dangerous, a little rest will
        cure them. Our baggage wagons are camped about a mile
        ahead of us across the river on a rich old Sesesh farm.
        The Regiment is away after Morgan on a three days scout.<br>
        I am sitting in the pulpit with pen and ink in the desk
        where the word of truth has been preached from Sabbath to
        Sabbath, where prayers have been offered by pious hearts
        in time past. When Peace reigned, but now , what a
        contrast! War makes everything different, a change for
        the worse, it appears&#133;&#133;<br>
        There was a Sesesh paroled prisoner buried here this
        morning. A regiment of Cavalry was encamped around the
        Church. There was no acrimony whatever, but few even
        looked for a moment, he belonged to the 6th Arkansas, a
        poor deceived following of Jeff&#133;<br>
        There is a rumor in camp that an armistice of sixty days
        was being reached upon between the North and South, that
        a settlement may be brought, but I don&#146;t believe it.
        We know nothing for certain never. Rumors of this and
        that are flying at all times. ----- send a paper now and
        then it is a great rarity to see a Michigan Paper or read
        the news. You may direct to Company B 4th Michigan
        Cavalry via Louisville, Kentucky and I guess it will find
        its way, Headqs? follow us up.<br>
        On our march here we passed the battlefield at
        Perryville. The battle was fought on Wednesday, we
        reached there Saturday. What a desolation it was &#150;
        Sesesh bodies were still lying on the field. Some close
        by the side of the road, dead horses, dead mules, broken
        wagons were scattered around. Our dead were all buried.
        2500 Sesesh dead were where they lay in a valley yet
        unburied, they were hurried away without giving them time
        to bury those killed. One passed 4 hearses on their way
        back , 3 generals and 1 colonel. That was a picture. I
        had read about it but never seen it before. It was
        horrible.<br>
        I can write everything and &amp; I can&#146;t write
        anything this morning excuse me. I shall leave the
        hospital tomorrow, I think. John Gilbert has been some
        sick. Write as often as you can for (?) get much time.
        Give my love to all. I hope to see you again, from
        Albert.</strong><p><strong>[note written in margin]<br>
        I understand that our quarters for the winter will be
        Nashville, but I doubt if we&#146;ll be given quarters at
        all. Bragg and Morgan are both running as fast as they
        can. Doubtful if they will risk another battle in Ky

        Dear Father <br>
        I had a good chance to get a letter in the office today.
        So I thought I would write a line. I am in the Hospital.
        I have had the jaundice pretty bad and then caught some
        cold. My throat has been very sore. I have put Oil of
        Hemlock on it so it is much better. I am going to get
        some Wild Cherry Bark &amp; liquor, make some bitters. I
        guess that will straighten me. I have taken Calomel
        Rhubarb for the jaundice. Dr Bacon of Dewitt is the
        assistant Surgeon. A very nice man. We are in a
        Presbyterian Church.<br>
        There is sixty sick here. Two or three are dangerous. The
        regiment is about 30 miles ahead at Munfordville. We have
        had about 3 inches of snow here. I suppose up home you
        have had a foot, perhaps. It is a very pleasant day. The
        dust which has been very unpleasant has simmered down.
        They have had no rain here for three months of any
        account. It is a hard place to get postage stamps here. I
        wish you would send me a dozen or so when you write. I
        hope to be with the regiment when we get our Pay for I
        have not a cent. John Gilbert has been some sick. Bilious
        as well as myself, but he is with the regiment. I will
        have to stop. </strong><p><strong>My love to you all and

        In Camp near Nashville, Tenn<br>
        <br>
        My dear Sister<br>
        Having time this afternoon, I thought I would write a
        line home and tell you of my whereabouts. I am felling
        nearly as well as ever only I tire out very easy. I have
        a good appetite. Have just been eating dinner. Had some
        fried shoulder, sweet potatoes, cold beans, bread and
        coffee. So you can see we don&#146;t live so bad here. It
        is only when we are on a scout or march that we have hard
        feed. Then we take it as we can catch it. John G.[John N.
        Gilbert] is in the hospital at Mitchellsville. He is
        pretty sick, or was when I was obliged to leave him. He
        is not in with the rest of the sick but has a good bed in
        a house near the Station. As he was rather weak, the
        surgeon did not move him from the place I got for him and
        I was very glad of it. I have not heard from him since I
        left and am some uneasy, but hope for the best. Levi
        Fishbeck is with him he will see to him perhaps as well
        as I would. I wanted to stay but the surgeon would not
        consent so I had to come on here. We are camped just
        across the river from Nashville, the capital of Tenn. I
        have been through the city, it is a pretty place, about
        half as large as Detroit. The State House is a splendid
        building built upon a hill. You can see it 3 or 4 miles
        from the city in any direction. The country around here
        is very fine. Nice farm houses with their little cabins
        in the rear for the darkies. They have no barns in this
        country of any account. A great many houses have been
        burnt along the road. The chimnies stand as a bleak
        monument of the desolation of war. I said we were camped,
        I only meant a detachment of the regiment under Lt Col
        Dickenson [William H. Dickenson]. The regiment is not here
        nor has it been. They are scouting around after Morgan.
        We expect them in now every day. There was fighting night
        before last about 17 miles from here. We think the 4th
        was engaged, but have heard no particulars. Lieut J.M.
        Carter[Julius M. Carter] is sick. He is at home near
        here. He thinks of coming home to get well. Our captain,
        Frank Mix is now with the company. The boys all like him
        first rate. I have not seen him yet. We have not drawn
        our pay yet and I doubt if we get any until the 1st of
        January. I am clean gone done, no done gone, that&#146;s
        it. I am dead broke. I guess I can stand it though if I
        don&#146;t have it I won&#146;t spend it. There is due me
        now about $40. Mother, I intend to pay you all up as soon
        as Uncle Sam pays me. Please send down your acct and I
        will fork over. There must be a right smart of it by this
        time, I reckon. When you write again tell me about the
        farming &#150; how much wheat was sown and where? Did
        they sow Meditteranean on Rhodes farm? How many potatoes
        was there? And how much corn? Are the horses fat? And all
        these little things. They are all very interesting to me.<br>
        You ought to see me do my washing. I washed out a couple
        pairs of socks yesterday and 4 pocket handkerchiefs
        today. I rubbed them out in soap suds until I thought
        they were clean. I then rubbed soap on them after
        wringing them out and boiled them up in the cooking
        kettle and then rinsed them out in cold water, was that
        right? And to iron them rubbed them out with my hands. I
        am very precise about this for I thought perhaps I might
        make a mistake. I guess it was all right but the cooking
        kettle. I send you a Confederate note. It is not the
        genuine but said to be a facsimile. I sent John a paper
        printed by the rebel Morgan. It is quite a curiosity.
        When we came into Nashville the other day I had no horse.
        I had been riding in the ambulance but when we got in the
        City I got out and walked and by that means did not keep
        up with the rest. A gentleman came along in a carriage
        and I asked him if I might ride a piece with him. He said
        yes! With the greatest of pleasure! I got in and finding
        that he lived nearwhere the regt was going thought I
        would ride all the way. He was a strong Union man. Was a
        member of the legislature when Tennessee seceded. His
        name is Trimball. He invited me to stay to dinner. I
        thanked him very much and excused myself, but he urged me
        so that I went in. And oh! You ought to have seen the
        style. I hardly dared to step on the carpets with my
        dirty boots. He introduced me to his wife, son and
        daughter and Mr. Richards an aid of Gen Negley&#146;s was
        also there to dinner. For dinner we had three courses
        Soup first, made of mixed vegetables such as we have in
        the Army. It is a mixture of cabbage, carrot, tomatoes,
        peppers, beets and other things all cut up fine. And
        pressed into cakes about an inch thick and preserved in
        some way. The 2nd course was a pigs-head, souse, snout
        and all and sweet potatoes. The 3rd was fried beef, wheat
        and corn bread all the way through. Cold water to drink
        in silver cups. After dinner I thanked them very much and
        took my leave. A friend of mine was to the city to see
        his cousin as it happened his cousin lived in the next
        house a large two story brick (Trimball&#146;s house
        stands upon a hill, a splendid house and so richly
        furnished. So much silver plate etc) and Mrs Trimball
        happened<br>
        in. Had an introduction and in the course of the
        conversation found out that I was in the same company and
        sent over a very polite invitation to take tea.
        Isn&#146;t that beautiful! For lo! And behold come to
        find out Mr Trimball is Attorney General of the State. I
        think I shall go over and marry in the family
        wouldn&#146;t you? Amelia, I have written this little
        adventure just because I had not much else to write and
        to show you how the richest families are obliged to live
        here. On acct of the war sugar is 75 cnts a pound, brown.
        Coffee $1.00 and hard to get at that. Milk and eggs are
        out of the question.<br>
        Apples are 10 cnts a piece, but we bought some a 2 for 5
        cnts in camp today. Gen Rosecrans&#146; headquarters is
        in Nashville. I have not seen him yet. The mail from the
        North is uncertain. I don&#146;t know when you will get
        this. I am sorry you have to stay at home when you might
        be at school but perhaps it is all for the best. By
        reading and thinking you may educate yourself to a
        certain degree but I think you might perhaps get a school
        next summer! You might set your mark there and try! Give
        my love to Emma and Anna and to Mrs Binck and all my
        friends. I am going to write to Mr Lancers the next I
        think. You may send a stamp or two in your next letter as
        they come very handy. It is about nine o&#146;clock. I am
        sergeant of the guard to night and will have to report
        myself. My love to you all. </strong><p><strong>Direct<br>
        to Nashville Tenn, <br>

        [written around the edge of the letter:]<br>
        You must excuse scarcity of news this letter is all
        stuff. Mr Gilbert&#146;s folks must not worry about John
        as he has good care I think he will soon be with us again
        hope so at least. The weather here is very fine. We have
        had a fine shower lately, just enough to lay the dust.
        They days are about such as we have home in Sept. The
        nights are cool. How is the weather up in Mich?<br>

        discharged August 6, 1863<br>

        Dear Mother<br>
        I received your paper today and Amelia&#146;s letter last
        night and have received all of the letters, stamps and
        papers you have sent me, I think. I am feeling first rate
        again. We just got in from a three day&#146;s scout
        yesterday. We went out on the turnpike to Lebanon after
        the rebels but they skedaddled before we got there.
        Sunday afternoon we came up to their pickets and had a
        light skirmish, no one hurt. Companies B and A were
        detailed as picket guard that night and it rained. Oh
        dear! We were not allowed any fires but had to stand it.
        I was wet as a drowned rat &#150; but did not catch a
        cold. So you see I am tough. You are foolish to think I
        am going to get shot or any such thing. Its time enough
        to think about such things when you have to. Mustn&#146;t
        look on that side. Well we captured some fine chickens on
        our scout and consequences was we had an excellent pot
        pie today for dinner and Lew Wilcox[Lewis H Wilcox] is
        baking some wheat pan cakes for supper. I must stop until
        I eat about a dozen or so. Well those cakes were not
        quite as good as yours for they were a little heavy being
        about ½ inch thick. But they tasted very good with
        sugar. Better than hard cracks. I heard from John
        yesterday he is getting quite smart. Able to walk some.
        By being careful he will soon be with us again. Alf
        Shepard[Alpheus F Shepard] wanted me to say for him that
        he was around. Billy Egleston[William H Egleston] has had
        a bad earache a day or two. He is well other ways. I
        don&#146;t want you to send me any more money. I was only
        telling how hard up I was. If rumors are true we will get
        our pay this week and then I can send you some. Give my
        love to George Rhodes. Tell him to improve his time at
        study, he will never regret it. Tell him to make my
        respects also to Mr Rhodes family. If Josiah lets old
        Charley go you must get a mate to Skip, don&#146;t go
        with out a team. There&#146;s no use of it. Better get
        another mare to raise a span of colts for me. We take all
        the good horses we find on our scouts. It seems rather
        hard but it is right nearly every family in the country
        about here to Lebanon are rebels. Company B has not been
        in any battles yet and is not likely to be very soon. You
        must recollect there are hundreds of regiments and
        thousands of companies in this great army. We may
        possibly serve our three years out and not see a large
        engagement. I have sent the likeness. You may send it to
        Aunt Nep when you get thro&#146;. I will send another one
        home when I get a chance. I have no news to tell you this
        time. Tell GJB I would like to hear from him. I wrote
        Neiman Lancer a week ago. Write often as you can. I do
        not always have time to write. I always write every
        chance.<br>
