		<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><font size="4">Having 
		made my arrangements for a month's tour in the west of Ireland, I set 
		out and met Edward Duffy, by appointment, in my travels. In Galway, the 
		City of the Tribes, we met some of the men, and it was arranged that a 
		more general meeting for consultation would ho held the following 
		Sunday, On the banks of a small river, a few miles to the north of the 
		city. Sunday came and the men came, too, bringing with them as much food 
		and kitchen as made a small picnic. A number of the men I met that day 
		are dead, the only one of them I can catch living now is Patrick 
		O'Connor, a gunsmith, doing business in New Haven, Conn. He, too, may ho 
		considered dead–dead to Ireland–because in America he joined in with the 
		crowd who went in for getting &quot;land without striking a blow.&quot; Gracious 
		goodness, when I think of the good men at home who grow rotten when they 
		come to America, I begin to think there is a far seeing wisdom In 
		England's policy of trying to get the Irish to emigrate to America. She 
		pretends it is of the Irish in America she is afraid, but it is only 
		pretense; it is of the Irish in Ireland and England she Is afraid; one 
		rebel Irishmen at home is worth 100 of his kind in distant America.</font></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><font size="4">After 
		Edward Duffy and I had spent the day with the Galway men outside of 
		Galway town, we came into the city in the evening, went down to the 
		Claddagh where the fishormen live and were taken over the bay in one of 
		the large hookers. Those Claddagh fishermen dress in a kind of blue 
		uniform, they speak the Irish language, and English is little known to 
		the older people of the community. England establishes national schools, 
		as she calls them, but when children go to these sellouts they must 
		learn the English language, not the Irish. No Irish books are allowed in 
		the National schools of Ireland–at least were not allowed in my days at 
		school. I learned the English language at one of those National schools. 
		I learned the Irish language at home, away from school, because I, too, 
		was born in a part of Ireland whore the Irish language is the business 
		language of the people. People say I Speak English with a brogue; ‘tis 
		no wonder, English is not my natural tongue. I speak it as correctly as 
		a German speaks it, and the German is not, ridiculed because of the 
		manner in which he speaks English. I grant an Irishman who does not 
		speak grammatically English the same immunity from the charge of 
		ignorance as I grant the Gorman or Frenchman who does not speak English 
		grammatically, that is, provided the Irishman can speak the Irish 
		language.</font></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><font size="4">Front 
		Galway Edward Duffy and I traveled to Athenry, and met some of the men 
		there. We went into that old abbey of which Hardiman, in his books of 
		Irish minstrelsy, tells this story: the castle and abbey were occupied 
		by the English. O'Connor laid siege to the places and was setting them 
		on fire; one of his lieutenants asked him not to lay the abbey In ruins, 
		as the bodies of some bishops were buried there. &quot;I care not,&quot; said he, 
		&quot;if it was my mother was buried there. I would lay it in ashes rather 
		than that, the Sassenagh should occupy it.&quot; From Athenry, Ned Duffy and 
		I went to Ballinasloe and spent a night there. Ned was known in 
		Ballinasloe and had a standing invitation to the hospitality of Mr. 
		Larkin, a pretty wealthy man who was a brother-in-law to P. W. Dunne, of 
		Peoria, one of the Fenian senators. We should go to supper there, but we 
		should meet the men at suppertime, too. We met the Fenians in a Inn 
		public house, aunt conducted our business with much dispatch as 
		possible, but one member was rather demonstrative; he should get up and 
		make a speech ; he did not see what we were to be afraid of that we 
		would not speak our mind and proclaim our Opinions; as for him he was 
		afraid of no one, and was as ready to fight for his country as he was to 
		proclaim to the world that he was ever ready to do so. From Ballinasloe 
		we went to Roscommon town and spent a night there; from Roscommon to 
		Castlereagh, and spent another night there. From Castlereagh we took a 
		jaunting car to Ballaghadereen, in the County Mayo; we were traveling by 
		night, and passing near a place called Loughglin, Edward Duffy stopped 
		the car at a house on the roadside, saying to me: &quot;It is here my mother 
		lives;&nbsp; let us go in and see her. She'll want to keep us all night, and 
		I know we'll have work to get away from her.&quot; He went to the door, the 
		mother met him and kissed him. &quot;Won't you stay till night, Eddie?&quot; said 
		she. “No, mother,” said he, &quot;we have to be in Ballaghadereen to meet the 
		people tonight, and we cannot break the appointment,&quot; She parted with 
		him shedding tears, giving him her blessing, Saying: &quot;You can't break 
		the appointment, Eddie, but you can break down your health in this way, 
		night after night as you do.&quot; Twas true for the poor mother, Ned Duffy 
		worked the Irish Revolutionary movement for what his health and his life 
		wern worth; when cast into prison, he had not sufficient strength to 
		stand for any length of time the ill treatment of his jailers.</font></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><font size="4">We made 
		Ballaghdereen our headquarters for a few days and from there took drives 
		into the country to see some members of the organization. It was decided 
		to hold a meeting one night on one of the mountains that lay central 
		between Ballymore, Boyle and Ballaghdereen. &quot;Shamus Andy,&quot; James Hyland 
		a school teacher who taught school in Scranton. Pa., some years ago, was 
		my guide to the meeting place, and such a night of travel through bogs 
		and brakes I had not before or since. When we got to the meeting place 
		we learned that a few hundred of the men of the district had by mistake 
		gone to another mountain top some three miles distant, near the Keish 
		Caves. the two parties communicated with each other by signal, but did 
		not come together that night. One thing discussed in that mountain that 
		night was this: The brothers of the Irish Revolutionary Society had been 
		working a few years past against much opposition: men who belonged to 
		another Irish society in the locality used to beat them at fair and 
		market and waylay them coming home at night; now they had grown too 
		strong to be beaten, they in fact were able to beat the others, and they 
		wanted permission to beat them into the Irish Revolutionary Brotherhood. 
		We would not give them the permission. We told them as they were strong 
		they could he merciful, and that the erring brother Irishmen would in 
		time see their way and join the society that would in time effect the 
		freedom of their land. In America this same folly is going on to-day of 
		society fighting against society, every Irish society jealous of the 
		other, and having as much bad blood against each other as the men of the 
		different counties and provinces are said to have had against, each 
		other a half a century ago. Fenianism killed that folly of county 
		against county in Ireland, but the Irish fools of America revive it in 
		the animosity of society against society here; there are thirty-two 
		Irish counties in Ireland, there are thirty-two Irish societies in 
		America and no two of them working harmoniously to do anything for the 
		freedom of Ireland. A society that makes the greatest pretension to 
		patriotism and liberality – the Clan na Gael Society–exempts you from 
		membership if you belong to any Irish revolutionary society. I am 
		ineligible for membership in it because I belong to the Fenian 
		Brotherhood, a brotherhood that receives every man of every creed, 
		provided he be a man of good character and a man of Irish blood. But 
		this Clan na Gael Society has been virtually turned into an American 
		Republican politician society, every prominent man in it was stumping 
		the country for the Republican party at the election last year; they and 
		their schemes were defeated, and the devil mend them. It arouses my ire 
		to see men mount to eminence and prominence making a ladder of my 
		country’s misfortunes, and saddled on the mountain of her miseries, 
		resting content that they are the recognized--the visiblo–leaders of the 
		Irish people, and that it is through them the Irish vote can be managed.</font></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><font size="4">The night 
		Ned Duffy and I met the men on the mountains near the Keish Caves, we 
		traveled into Boyle; It was about one o'cloek when we got to town, we 
		were rapping at the hotel door when Red James MacDermott, who is now 
		living In Philiadelphia, came up and recognized us; he led us to 
		quarters for the night; another good man in Ireland, but a man lost to 
		Ireland in Philadelphia. Next day we went to Carrick on Shannon and met 
		more McDermotts there, good men too; one of them, .Arthur, drowned in a 
		river while he was gunning a short time after we met him. When I think 
		of all these good Irishmen dead–when I think of myself dead, perhaps 
		without striking a blow for Ireland's freedom–I think and ask myself 
		wouldn't it be just as good for oursolves and the world if we had all 
		fighting for freedom of our land and race?</font></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><font size="4">Ballymote 
		was the next place we visited, we stopped at Boyle and 
		Carrick-on-Shannon. We stopped at O'Hara's and met our friends there; it 
		was in this neighborhood General Michael Corcoran, of the American war, 
		was born, and we met some of his friends and acquaintances. Here is the 
		famous old Irish abbey and castle of Ballymote, where the holy fathers 
		wrote the historical &quot;Book of Ballymote.&quot; I went through that castle, 
		and a grand castle it must have been in the days of its glory. As it 
		stands now, or as it stood twenty years ago, there was a hallway running 
		through the center of its outer wall, and through that hallway I walked 
		all around, the windows here and there giving you a view of the 
		surrounding country.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </font></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><font size="4">From 
		Ballymoto we went to Tubbercurry, the home of P. J. Sheridan, who had to 
		go &quot;on the run'' after Cavendish and Burke were slain in Dublin. I did 
		not meet him in Tubbercurry that time, he was rather young, then, but I 
		met some other good men there. Pat O'Brien, who is now in the Street 
		Cleaning Department of New York with. Commissioner Coleman and Mr Cook, 
		of Providence, Rhode Island, whose faather kept the hotel at which we 
		put up. From Tubbercurry we went to Swineford, thence to Ballina and 
		thence to Killala, where the French landed the last years of the last 
		country. John Sheridan, of Ballina traveled those places with us – 
		another man who thought he would never die till he would see Ireland's 
		fight for freedom, but he went to his long home five or six years ago 
		without seeing the long long wished for hour to hand.</font></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><font size="4">We held a 
		meeting in the ruins of the old Abbey of Moyne, a mile or two outside 
		of&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It is one of the best preserved relies of those monuments of 
		old Irish grandeur. There is an old Irish round tower in Killala which 
		is the best preserved monumont of the kind that I have seen in Ireland. 
		Anthony Timony's fainmy, now in Brooklyn, saw me at</font></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><font size="4">Killala 
		that day.</font></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><font size="4">Sligo was 
		our next place of meeting. The night we entered thin town the Sligo 
		militia wore on drill there, and we held consultation with thirty or 
		forty of them. They said they would have nearly the whole regiment sworn 
		in before they would disband. Next night we met Tom Ward, Paddy Marrin 
		and Dominick Kilcullen, who were the best trusted men in the locality; 
		they belonged to another Irish society and promised to be with us When 
		the time came to fight against the common enemy, bringing into the field 
		two thousand men. Those three men, Paddy Marrin, Dominick Kilcullen and 
		Tom Ward, are dead. So it is not treasonable or dangerous to them to 
		talk of their names, but their death ought to be a lesson to all men to 
		fight for their rights while they hays youth and strength, and not be 
		waiting for a “time” or an “opportunity” that never comes unless to 
		those who make their own time and opportunity.</font></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><font size="4">From 
		Sligo Edward Duffy and I made our way down to Castlebar, crossing the 
		Mayo lakes over tht Pontoon bridge. There was a police barrack at the 
		off end of the bridge. Some of the polico were playing hand ball in a 
		ball alley attached to it. Ned and I stopped our jaunting car and looked 
		at the game for awhile; we thought it was the best way to avert their 
		attention from us. Dan Donnelly, a baker, was one of the principal men 
		we had to meet in Castlebar. We met him with some others. Dan is gone to 
		his long home, too. After spending a day and night in Castlebar we went 
		to Westport. One of the best workers there was a Protestant young man 
		named Rosengrave, who is now doing business in one of the big dry goods 
		houses in Walker street, New York. The Protestants who belonged to the 
		organization all proved to be good men and none of them turned out 
		informers, if I except Warner, of Bandon, but he was a Protestant who 
		had previously turned himself into a Catholic-had bonnie a turncoat. In 
		the work of organization in Ireland, England and Scotland, I never 
		trusted a man who had been a Protestant and turned Catholic, or a man 
		who had been a Catholic and turned Protestant. I was in North Shields, 
		England, one night; the men told me there was a very patriotic man there 
		who was an officer high up in the labor organizations; they were taking 
		me to his house, but learning on the way that he was a holy Roman 
		Catholic now, but had been bred, born and reared a Protestant, I 
		declined to travel further toward his house, and declined seeing him on 
		the subject of my missionary work. Barney Kane, of Berry Edge and 
		Belfast, was with me that night. If a man is bred, born and reared a 
		Protestant I like to see him live and die one; if a man is bred, born 
		and reared a Catholic I like to see him live and die one; I take no 
		stock in the patriotism or piety of men who change their religion; there 
		may be good stock in them, but I have not trained myself to put trust in 
		it. I saw in America seven or eight years ago that seven or eight of the 
		Catholic bishops in America had been Protestants in their day, and as 
		Catholic bishops they were vehement denouncers of Fenianism. Speaking to 
		a priest on that matter and on the injustice of making those converts or 
		perverts bishops over the heads of priests whose &quot;seed, breed and 
		generation&quot; were ever faithful to the true faith, &quot;Yes,&quot; said the 
		priest, &quot;and when one of them turns over to us he thinks there is 
		nothing in the church too good to pay him for what he has done; he 
		thinks the mere act of his turning from a Protestant to a Catholic 
		should entitle him to the highest position the Catholic Church could 
		bestow.&quot; This was said of converts who had been in holy orders in the 
		Protestant Church before they turned.</font></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><font size="4">But I 
		must come back to my story: I must not leave Edward Duffy travel through 
		Connacht alone. Ned and I hired a jaunting car at Daly's hotel in 
		Castlebar one day and drove out to Balla, a distance of seven or eight 
		miles. When we got into the town we learned that George Henry Moore, 
		Justice of the Peace of Moore Hall, was in town, and as I had a letter 
		of introduction to him from Thomas Neilson Underwood, of Tyrone, I 
		determined to deliver it. He was in tile Court House, and into the Court 
		House I went; I sat down there listening to the magistrates trying a 
		case. Mr. Blake, a brother in law of George, Henry Moore, was either 
		plaintiff or defendant in the case, on which account Mr. Moore did not 
		take a seat on the bench; he sat among the spectators. By and by, when 
		the hearing in the lawsuit was concluded. George Henry Moore came out 
		and walked toward the hotel. As he was going to the house I arrested his 
		attention quietly, saying;</font></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><font size="4">&quot;I beg 
		your pardon, sir, 1 understand you are Mr. George Henry Moore, of Moore 
		Hall, I have a. letter of introduction to you from Mr. Neilson Underwood 
		of Strabane. I wish to deliver it to you privately.&quot; &quot;Walk along with us 
		into the hotel.&quot; said he. I did so. I gave him tho letter. He read It. 
		He asked tine,&quot; How are you here – have you any conveyance? Where are 
		you going?' I told him I had a friend with me, that we brought a car 
		with us front Castlebar and were on our way to Tuam.</font></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><font size="4">&quot;Now,” 
		said he, &quot;Mr. Blake, my brother its law is here with me. I want to have 
		some talk with you, but we cannot have him present and I cannot get away 
		from him intro; can you not drive on to Moore Hall an hour or so after I 
		leave here? It is on your way to Tuam; we can then talk this business 
		over.'' &quot; All right, Mr. Moore,&quot; said I, &quot;We’ll do that,&quot; and</font></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><font size="4">1 slipped 
		away from him.</font></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><font size="4">Moore 
		Hall was five or six miles distant, and we got there in due time. Mr. 
		Moore walked through the lawn with us and talked over the past and the 
		present and the future of Ireland. He had an idea that the best tray to 
		meet the difficulties that beset us was to have men at the chapel gates 
		on Sundays with pen, ink and paper, taking down the names of all who 
		were willing to fight &quot;in defense of the country in time of danger.&quot; 
		That would be working within the law, or at least in evasion of the law, 
		and then when the danger came, when the time to fight came, those men 
		who put down their names to fight should be made to fight whether they 
		liked it or not.&quot; You <i>cannot</i>,&quot; said he, &quot;get the messes of the 
		People into your society against the wishes of the priests, nor can you 
		keep the existence of a secret society secret against their public 
		denunciations of it. I am not speaking now for myself; I am only 
		speaking for what you have to encounter in organizing your resources.&quot;</font></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><font size="4">George 
		Henry Moore Impressed mo with the belief that he was one of the most 
		important men in Ireland for our cause. I could not go any further with 
		him than I wont; he was ready and willing to go with me as far an I 
		liked. I wished him to meet James Stephens, and he expressed his 
		willingness to do so as soon as I could arrange a meeting. James 
		Stephens was then in England, and it was arranged that as soon as he 
		returned to Dublin I was to send word to Mr. Moore that “the horses had 
		arrived from England, and it he wished to see them before they were 
		taken to the Curragh he could come up to Dublin immediately.” </font>
		</p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><font size="4">Moore 
		Hall is one of the lordly mansions of Ireland. George Henry Moore told 
		us that day that it cost him as much every year to keep all its old 
		Irish appurtenances in repair as would build a moderate mansion. He 
		asked us to see his stable of race horses; he took us into the dinning 
		room and ordered some wine from the cellar; he said we should stay for 
		dinner, only that it was Friday and on Fridays the family observed the 
		observances of the Catholic Church and had only fish dinners. We spent a 
		most agreeable evening, with George Henry Moore, and parted with him, 
		promising him to let him have the earliest notice of Mr. Stephens return 
		home. Ned Duffy and I were in high spirits at our interview with him. 
		Our carman kept waiting for us for fear we would miss Bianconi's stage 
		coach that was to pass that way to Tuam, and just as we came out on the 
		road we saw the stage coming toward us in the distance. We paid off our 
		Jarvey and sent him toward Caslebar. As the stage came up we got seats 
		on it. About two miles down the road we stopped at the stables to change 
		horses, and as the stable man canto out, leading the fresh horses, he 
		gave a screech that frightened around him. &quot;Holy Jehosophat: Mr. 
		O'Donovan how in the world are you, and what brought you into Connacht?&quot; 
		said he as he let go the horses and caught, me by the two hands. His 
		name was Hogan: he was a Tipperary man and was in Bianconi’s stables in 
		Skibbereen a few years before that, where he came to know me. Lately he 
		had been transferred to Connacht. I told him to keep his knowedge of me 
		to himself, to tell no one who I was, and as the coach rolled on he had 
		a bonfire of straw lit and kept hurrahing and waving the burning sheaves 
		after us till we were out of sight. Poor Hogan! ‘tis in hearts like 
		yours the fire of Irish patriotism burns brightly; 'tis spirits like 
		yours that cheer me on my way.</font></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><font size="4">At Tuam, 
		in the County Galway, we put up at Daly's Hotel, and met the men of the 
		district. We took a car out as far as Dunmore and met some more of them 
		there. Wo then went into Longford, Westmeath and Meath, and gave the men 
		in those places all the encouragement we could. Many men now in America 
		will think I am forgetting them or slighting them, because I do not 
		mention meeting them in those travels of mine, but I am neither 
		forgetting nor slighting them. Tom Masterson, of New York, will think I 
		forgot having met him at his home in Navan. Edward McCloskey, 570 Myrtle 
		avenue, Brooklyn, will think I forgot having met him at his home in 
		Glasgow; others will think like them; but I forget nothing in connection 
		with those travels of mine in Fenianism. I am prisoned within a certain 
		inclosure. I get space for ten letters on my subject, this is the tenth. 
		I have done my best to be brief, but I find I have not told half my 
		story. As I said already, I traveled through thirty-one of the 
		thirty-two counties of Ireland. My experience in all places are similar 
		to those I have spoken of in some of the places I passed through.</font></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><font size="4">When I 
		got back to Dublin, a week after my visit to George Henry Moore, I 
		learned that James Stephens had come in the same day. I saw him that 
		night. Next day I sent a message to Mr. Moore telling him the horses had 
		arrived, and the second day following he called into the Irish People 
		office, Mr. Stephens met him that night. He never told me what the 
		nature or result of the meeting was. He simply said everything was all 
		right; but I could suspect every thing was not all right. John O'Leary, 
		our editor told mo tho proposition Mr. Stephens made to Mr. Moore was 
		that he (Mr. Moore) go to America and travel, and speak there as an 
		organizer of resources for the movement.</font></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><font size="4">It seems 
		it was not convenient or agreeable to Mr. Moore to go to America on that 
		mission; anyway he did not go. I know no more of what passed between the 
		two gentlemen; but this I know, the when I was in prison George Henry 
		Moore was instrumental in getting me released therefrom; Its made some 
		noise in Parliament about the ill treatment the Irish prisoners were 
		subjected to; that noise led to a commission of inquiry. We established 
		the truth of the charges George Henry Moore made against the Government, 
		and the day the report of the Commission of &nbsp;Inquiry was published in a 
		blue book, that day an order was issued for our release from prison, 
		provided we quit the country. George Henry Moore was dead; the good 
		people die young in Ireland.</font></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><font size="4">In the 
		Autumn of 1864 a delegation of Irishmen came from Sheffield, England, to 
		see Mr. Stephens. I took their papers and delivered them to him and 
		arrangements were made for a meeting. It was at Joe Deniffe’s in 32 Anne 
		street, Dublin, he read the papers. They represented that the Irishmen 
		of England, when the rising took place in Ireland, wanted permission to 
		give the enemy such trouble in England as would engage all the soldiers 
		that were in the country; in a word, the Irishmen of England wanted 
		permission to set fire to the towns and cities of the country and so 
		prevent any of the redcoats from going to Ireland to shoot down the 
		Irish people. Mr. Stephens told the delegation their proposition would 
		have due consideration and they would hear from him in due time before 
		the eve of action. When the delegation withdrew he handed me the papers 
		they had presented to him, &quot;What am I to do with them?&quot; said I, &quot;Do as 
		you please with them,&quot; said he. I took a match off the mantelpiece, 
		lighted it and set fire to the papers, putting them in the grate and 
		seeing they were burnt. I know Mr. Stephens would rather that I had 
		preserved the papers, but his standing orders to mo were to destroy all 
		dangerous documents that would come into my hands, and in his presence 
		on this occasion I carried out his orders. He then told me I had better 
		put my house in order and take a tour through England and Scotland; the 
		men in these places were calling for some one to visit them.</font></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><font size="4">I told 
		him it was very inconvenient for me to make the journey just then as I 
		had promised a young lady in the South of Ireland that I was going to 
		marry her in a week's time, and for fear of “breach of promise” as well 
		as for regard and affection for the lady, I should keep my word. &quot;Well,&quot; 
		said he, &quot;keep your word, and tell the men over the water you will be 
		with them in a week's time.&quot;</font></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><font size="4">He gave 
		me £30 for thirty days' traveling expensed; then I asked him for £30 of 
		my own money which I had lent him for the starting of the newspaper, and 
		he gave it to me. I wanted this to meet my coming wife's expenses; it 
		would not do to marry an Irish poetess one day and run away from her the 
		next— staying away for a month— I know she was not the kind of Irish 
		girl that would stand it quietly, so I made up my mind to make my tour 
		of treason her honeymoon tour.</font></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><font size="4">I bade 
		goodby to James Stephens, telling him I’d go down to Cork to get 
		married, and take shipping in Cork for Liverpool. That I may make all 
		due preparation for the ceremony of marriage I went to the priest of my 
		parish to get a marriage license. Mr. Stephens' brother in law, George 
		Hopper, went with me. I think the priest was Father Meehan, of St. 
		John's parish. Everything was all right till he canto to get My name and 
		address and occupation; but when he came to learn that the man who was 
		going to get married was Jeremiah O'Donovan Rossa, publisher of the 
		Irish People newspaper, 12 Parliament Street, Dublin, he hesitated, and 
		thought he could not give me a formal license. I asked him why, and he 
		said I had not been at confession. I told him 1 was ready to go to 
		confession to him.</font></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><font size="4">&quot;Oh,&quot; 
		said he, &quot;it would be no use, I could out give you absolution; now that 
		I know you. I should ask you certain questions, and your answering them 
		would preclude the possibility of my being able to give you a 
		certificate. Then ho talked of the late pastorals of Bishop Cullen, of 
		the late councils of other bishops, of the Pope's condemnation or 
		someone’s condemnation of &quot;Fratres Fenianores,&quot; and such other wicked 
		people, all of which I told hint did not affect my case. I pressed him 
		for the license, he gave me the 'informal one, the one which said I had 
		not been to confession and had not conformed to the requirements of the 
		occasion. I gave him a gold pound, the customary gratuity, and took the 
		train for Cork City.</font></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><font size="4">I had to 
		go to Clonakilty, some forty miles outside of Cork City, to meet the 
		young lady I wanted to marry; all the priests there knew me, and I know 
		the parish priest, Father Leander, would be mad with me and mad with the 
		handsomest girl in his parish for marrying me. So for fear of trouble 
		about the question of going to confession in Clonakilty where I was 
		known by the priests, I thought I would seek out a priest in Cork City 
		who did not know me, and go to confession to him.</font></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><font size="4">I went 
		into a chapel at the north side of the Myer Lee, near the north gate 
		bridge, and knelt at the feet of a priest who was robed in white 
		flannel. I confessed my sins to him, and as if he was inspired to 
		suspect there was something wicked connected with my life, he began to 
		ask me questions about secret societies: Did I belong to any secret 
		society? I did not. Did I belong to any oath bound society? I did. What 
		was It? A military organization sworn to fight for Ireland's freedom. &quot;I 
		cannot give you absolution for it,” said he. &quot;I do not want absolution 
		for it,&quot; said I. “Tis for my sins I seek absolution, not for my 
		virtues.”&nbsp; “You must give it up,” said he: &quot;I must not give it up,&quot; said 
		I, &quot;I have come into your presence to make a confession of my sins. I 
		have made that confession. You question me on matters that I do not 
		regard as sinful, that I in the presence of God do not feel are sinful. 
		And you refuse me the sacraments because of some crotchet of your own or 
		of some other men in the church. I fool before God that I have done my 
		duty in approaching the confessional. You turn me away from the tribunal 
		of penance. I will go away, and henceforward I will leave myself in the 
		hands of God and His mercy.&quot;</font></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><font size="4">I Went to 
		Clonakilty, went to the parish priest, Father Lea[n]der, and showed him 
		my &quot;Informal&quot; license. He said I should go to the bishop before he could 
		marry me. I told him I had not time to go to the bishop, that I should 
		sail for England next day, that Miss Irwin would go with me to Cork, 
		where we could get married, her father accompanying us—if he did not 
		marry us in Clonakilty. He said Miss Irwin would not show such a bad 
		example to the young girls of the parish as to leave it with a strange 
		man without getting married. I told him I was not a strange man in that 
		parish, that everyone belonging to me was known there for generations 
		before me. The bride, and her father were present. He asked the father 
		would he let his daughter go out of the parish with me without getting 
		married; he said he would if the priests in Clonakilty would not marry 
		us and that he himself would accompany us to Cork. He asked the bride if 
		she would leave the parish with a strange man without being married to 
		him; she said she would go to Cork and get married to me there, if he 
		did not marry us. At this he raged furiously and. addressing me, said:
		</font></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><font size="4">&quot;Oh, 
		whatever be your hostility to our poor old Mother Church, that has 
		protected us and promises to protect us through all ages-whatever you do 
		to create disrespect of the ministers of our holy religion and to 
		corrupt society, leave us-do leave us one thing: leave us the virtue of 
		our women,&quot;</font></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><font size="4">By Jove, 
		didn't I feel this to be hard? But the man who said it was a priest and 
		there was no strength in my arm. He is dead and God be merciful to him; 
		but my wife is living to bear witness to the truth of what I say. We got 
		an order to the curate of the parish to marry us, and &quot;If we don't live 
		happy that you may.&quot;</font></p>
