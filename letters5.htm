        May 3rd 1864</b><p><b>Dear Father</b></p>
        <p><b>I rec&#146;d a lettr from you a few days ago, but
        have lost it. Am glad you are all getting well again. I
        am not very tough at present but am felling better every
        day. The regiment and Brigade has moved to the front, I
        think to Chattanooga as soon as they get where I can
        rejoin them, I shall do so by rail. Col Park[Josiah B
        Park, Ovid Mich] told me he would telegraph me to what
        place to come. Lt Carter[Lt Julius M Carter, Ovid,
        Mich]is with me. We are boarding at a Rivalto(?) house, a
        Mr Sheppard, very nice people especially Mrs Shepard. We
        have plenty of music and singing, a piano and plenty of
        girls. They are all Southern here at heart but they are
        loyal with the tongue. The girls sing us southern songs
        with our permission of course, we allow them to sing what
        they choose. They have a brother in the Southern Army and
        they feel a certain sympathy which is natural and right.
        I think of my own home very often and how anxious you all
        are and I can but admit that if we had all been born and
        lived down here that probably we would have been just as
        these people here are, Rebels. Perhaps you will think I
        am getting tainted with treason myself but you know me
        better than that. I do not approve of the course
        Tennessee has taken. She has brought ruin and desolution
        upon herself, but people here are so different. The
        flower and the pride of Tennessee is in the Rebel Army.
        Her educated and enlightened class are there and I
        believe them to be conscientious. They think or thought
        they were right and now their Pride will not let them
        come back. K cannot blame the mother or sister who will
        sympathize for the cause their sons and brothers are
        engage in under the circumstances.<br>
        You must give up the idea of seeing me before Autumn. I
        cannot come if my health is good. The army has a great
        deal to do this summer and I have a company&#146;s
        responsibility to attend to. I cannot come. I believe the
        rebellion will be ended theis summer. I have all
        confidence in Grant if Lee outgenerals him on the Potomac
        and we cannot get Richmond, I believe the Rebels will be
        recognized by foreign powers. But Grant knows that as
        well as anybody this summer will tell the story. <br>

        health is not extra but gaining. Our regiment has moved.
        They went on last Saturday. I got permission to join them
        by railroad. I expect they are going to Chattanooga, it
        will be much easier for me than to march all the way on

        Near Villanow, Ga May 13/64</b><p><b>Dear Father<br>
        I wrote home last from Columbia, Tenn. And a letter to
        John[John Gilbert, Ovid, Mich] from Chattanooga on Sunday
        the 8th. I started from Columbia last Saturday for the
        front by the RR. Reached Stevenson that night about 2 ½
        pm Staid at Soldier&#146;s Home the only hotel in that
        place and that was kept free of expense by Uncle Sam.
        Reached Chattanooga at 5 pm Sunday found our Train then
        but the regiment was at Lafayette, Ga. Staid all night
        and part of Monday when we moved out to Rossville and
        camped for the night. Tuesday marched all day steady -
        found the regiment at Lafayette about 5 pm. Got a letter
        from Amelia. From [there] we marched that night 11 miles
        over Taylor&#146;s Ridge to Villanow where we are now. We
        had the most terrific storm of rain, thunder, and
        lightning I ever experienced that night. The column
        marched very fast which kept the rear on a trot. The
        darkness was so intense you could not distinguish
        ANYTHING above or below. The rain pound down so that
        gullies were formed even under the horses feet. The road
        was rough, steep, and rocky. The poor horses, urged
        onward by the men and blinded by the vivid and
        incandescent flashes, were totally bewildered. When the
        lightning flashed and lit up the path they would make a
        rush for the horse ahead of them, when the darkness,
        thick enough to be felt or cut, closed down they would
        stop like stocks or, still goaded, would pitch blindly
        into the bush on either side. The road in the morning was
        strewed with hats, caps, canteens, haversacks, rubber
        blankets, etc. with here and there a poor horse or mule
        who had given up the ghost. I cannot tell you &#150; it
        was the worst night I ever saw of the kind. I have
        suffered with cold and hunger many nights, but this was
        ahead in honor and grandeur, in light and blackness, in
        cursing and laughing that I ever saw or hope to see.<br>
        We have had no fighting yet, but are kept in readiness to
        move at a moment&#146;s notice. I send this by Dr
        Armstrong [Charles T Armstrong, Surgeon, Ovid, Mich] who
        has a leave of absence granted. There has been more or
        less cannonading at Dalton for 3 or 4 days. What the
        result is I do not know. The report is today that the
        Rebels are evacuating the place. By looking on a map you
        can see our position. We are SW from Dalton 12 miles.
        McPherson is reported in Sugar Valley near the RR to
        Atlanta at Resaca. Gen. Thomas Hd Qrs are within a mile
        of here. Sherman is near here. I believe we have the
        advantage of them at every point. Last night we recd a
        dispatch from Grant that he was within a mile of Richmond
        with 25,000 prisoners. I can hardly believe it is so. It
        is too early to speculate much yet. One more week will
        tell on way or the other. We are expecting to move every
        moment. I am feeling firstrate. <br>

        Sunday May 22nd AD 1864</b></p>
        <p><b>Dear Sister</b></p>
        <p><b>I wrote a letter to John[John Gilbert, Ovid, Mich]
        a few days ago telling of our hard fight the other day.
        But to day as we are in camp I will write to you. My
        health is good. We are having very warm weather at
        present. Our Division moves tomorrow with 20 days
        rations, as does the whole army. I believe.<br>
        I send you some Photographs. My company was in the
        extreme advance the 18th. I had my men deployed as
        skirmishers on the left on a hill our attention all
        directed to the front when a regiment of rebels came
        charging around to my left and near. Yelling like
        incarnate fiends. My men saw the situation as soon as I
        and giving orders to fall back to the road we succeeded
        in reaching amid a perfect shower of leaden hail which
        cut the boughs and twigs above my head in every
        direction. We had run upon two Brigades of Confederate
        cavalry and with in ½ mile of their permanent camp. The
        road runs between two hills all the way we had no support
        (that was the [truth] of it) for four miles back. But
        were obliged to fight it out alone. They flanked us badly
        and had us entirely surrounded all but breaking the
        column. I did not expect to get out without being wounded
        or captured. But the bullets slighted me that time. Billy
        Egleston[William R Egleston, Lapeer, Mich, Captain Co B]
        was wounded in the fight near Rome, nothing serious
        however. Carter [Julius M Carter, Ovid, Mich] is doing
        well I hear and on his way home. I had one brave sergeant
        shot dead. I have some of the coolest and bravest men in
        any Co I ever saw. I saw many a rebel bite the dust from
        their shots, well-aimed. They lost a Col killed 2nd
        Georgia.<br>
        We are resting today. The Army will advance in a day or
        two. The Trains are running regular to Kingston four
        miles north of us. We are about 60 miles from Atlanta.
        Report says Johnson[CSA General J E Johnston] will make a
        stand not far below here. No betting. We will know when
        we try them. We have flanked them out of Dalton and
        Resaca, two very strongly fortified places, naturally and
        artificially and we can flank them again or, if they will
        fight, we can whip them. They say Johns[t]on is reported
        to have said if he got whipped again he would retreat to
        Atlanta and hoist the stars and stripes.<br>
        I have not recd any letters in a long time. Don&#146;t
        know where they are. You must keep writing.<br>
        We are encamped in a good place. Plenty of shade and a
        beautiful spring of cool water near. Whatever the rebel
        have preached and said about holding this country against
        the whole Yankee army. I know one thing, the citizens
        have lost all faith in them or their army, as is proved
        by the fine deserted residences, beautiful gardens or
        flowers, superb carriages and plated harness left in the
        flight from the &#145;invader.&#146; I tell you Southern
        Aristocracy is &quot;played out&quot; after this war is
        ended this country will be peopled by a different set of
        people. <br>

        May 30th 1864<br>
        Dear Father</b><p><b>My health is good but we are all
        about tired out. The Cavalry has never had such hard
        wor[k] or so much fighting. Our horses have not had a
        feed of grain in four days. They cannot go much further. <br>
        The whole rebel army is in front of us. They are
        determined to drive us back or die. Night before last
        they made an assault upon our lines but were repulsed
        with a loss of 800. Last night there was the most
        terrific fighting I ever heard. The whole rebel army I
        should judge was charging upon our lines. I have had no
        report of the result yet. Only that we held our line
        firmly. Their loss must be terrible. Such firing and
        crashing and moaning was never heard. Our Cavalry fell
        back to the left and we were four miles in the rear when
        the assault was made. The whole sky was lit up as if the
        world was on fire. A sullen and continuous roar was
        heard. The sound would rise and fall like the waves of
        ocean. The earth fairly trembled and shrunk from the
        shock of hundreds of cannon. I am confident of success.
        We CANNOT fail. Our Army is large, larger than you
        imagine and our cause is just. From the Potomac I hear
        nothing. The 4th Mich has been in four fights at
        Kingston, Rome, Dallas and near Pumpkinvine Creek. We
        have had one Maj. (Grant)[Horace D Grant, Jackson,
        Michigan] captured. Our Maj. Robbins [Richard B Robbins,
        Adrian, Michigan] wounded, one Capt. (Lawton)[George W
        Lawton, Antwerp, Michigan] severely wounded and Lieuts.
        Carter[Julius M Carter, Ovid, Michigan] and
        Randolph[Smith Randolph, Madison, Michigan]. Carter is
        coming home, he is badly wounded, but not fatally. Our
        loss may be near 75 men, killed, wounded, and missing, 5
        officers and about 100 horses.<br>
        I have not had but one nights good rest in a week. We
        marched all last night. I am tough or I could not stand
        it.<br>
        We are receiving reenforcements enough to more than make
        up for their loss.<br>
        Gens Howard and Johnson were wounded day before
        yesterday. <br>
        The rebels were cut to pieces with grape and canister
        when they charged. Dallas is full of rebel legs and arms.
        They were struck in the thigh and bowels mostly.<br>
        Joe Johnson says if whipped here he will raise the stars
        and stripes in Atlanta.<br>
        Thomas is the center. McPherson the right. Schofield the
        left and our cavalry has been on the right.<br>
        Our Army is now concentrated.<br>
        The war will close in 1864.<br>

        <p><b>I rec&#146;d your humid letter Friday. It was the
        first from Ovid in some time. Am sorry to hear of the
        brave boys of the 27th so many wounded and killed. It is
        hard. Has George [Barck?] arrived home yet? I suppose
        Lieut Carter[Julius M Carter, Ovid, Mich] is home ere
        this. He was badly hurt, but I hope he will get along
        well. He fought well and is a brave man. He will tell you
        of our fighting. Our loss has been 4 officers wounded, 1
        captured, and about 50 killed and wounded enlisted men.
        Billy Egleston[William R Egleston, Ovid, Mich] was
        wounded, but slightly in leg. We have a great many horses
        shot, have been in two fights since Carter was wounded. I
        have escaped without a scratch so far. Our Cavalry has
        suffered much. We have been eight days without forage for
        our horses excepting green wheat which is bad and
        weakening.<br>
        [US Cavalry General] Stoneman went out with 4000
        splendidly mounted men. I understand he has but 1500 now.
        We have been nearly as bad off. My health is good - first
        rate. I live well now. Have had young potatoes, green
        peas, strawberries.<br>
        If report is true, our forces are now in Marrietta. We
        are somewhat to the rear now. We had to get back on
        left[?] of our horses, are guarding an important Gap in
        the Allatoona Mts and protecting the RR. The cars run
        down to the River now. As soon as the Bridge is built we
        will have clear sailing to the Chatthoochee.<br>
        Everything is working as it should. I believe by the 4th
        July our Army will be in Atlanta and Grant in Richmond.
        If we whip them thorough, I hardly think they will
        concentrate again. They may make a show until after the
        election in hope that some other man will get into the
        presidency than Old Abe, but they will be disappointed

        Why can&#146;t Uncle E.M.[Evan Malbern Potter, his uncle]
        write once in a while? Tell him I shall go back on him
        soon if he don&#146;t and others around him there too. I
        am tough and healthy and black and am getting as gray as
        a rat. I shall have to come home soon or I shall never be
        able to marry. I&#146;m getting so OLD. I am glad to hear
        of uncle Abe&#146;s nomination and believe
        Johnson&#146;s[Andrew Johnson -VP nominee] also good.
        That is I believe it to be policy. I don&#146;t really
        like old Andy. He is an office seeker, but he stands
        square for the Union and the War so he&#146;s allright.
        They will be elected. I think less of John C
        Fremont[Nominee of the Radical Republicans - later
        withdrew] than ever &#150; to think he would accept a
        nomination from such a source. It looks as if for an
        office he would endanger our country, for I believe that
        our country&#146;s salvation rests1stly with the army and
        2ndly with the election of Lincoln. To elect any other
        man will encourage the rebels to hope for a change of
        policy in their favor and would look as if there was a
        division and loss of confidence in the North is to be and
        should be avoided.<br>
        It is amusing to read some of the Free Press editorials
        about Mr. Lincoln losing confidence of the Army. All bosh
        They will see this fall. We expect to be in Atlanta by
        the 4th of July. Yours Truly<br>

        busy in moving all the month. I wrote the last I think
        before the Evacuation of Marietta and the Mountain
        Kenesaw. I have been well all the time. We have had no
        fighting of any consequence since the 20th June.
        &#150;are having very hot weather. I never saw such
        intense heat. The Army seems to stand it firstrate.
        &#150;hardly any sickness. It seems a little like Sunday
        today and but a Little too we are resting today. I got up
        at 8 o&#146;clock feeling as tired as if I had been
        mowing and cradling all yesterday. Had a breakfast of
        Pork, Potatoes, Onions, Coffee, and lots of Blackberries
        and apples are getting ripe too. Harvest apples sweet and
        sour. I will give you a little journal of our moves this
        month so far.<br>
        July 1st In camp all day, very warm five miles from
        Marietta <br>
        July 2nd In Camp showery. At 8 pm. Moved towards Big
        Shanty four miles and encamped instant unsaddling.<br>
        July 3rd Sherman with nearly all the army is moving to
        the right and flanking the mountain. The 2nd Div Cav
        moved to the left of the mt. The road was clear, rebels
        all gone. Took possession of Marietta at 11 am. Which is
        a handsome place built in a grove of trees. The villages
        are all built in the woods as one might say. The rebs
        left last night at 12m. We captured 400 I understand from
        news a deserter brought in as to their position. Report
        says Johns[t]on is falling back eight miles beyond
        Atlanta to a position of Cedar mt. Moved out three miles
        east of town and encamped.<br>
        July 4th Reveille at 2 am eat breakfast. I don&#146;t
        like to get up so early. Our band played Hail Columbia
        and Yankee Doodle. This morning on soil which we have not
        occupied before since the Rebellion. Very warm did not
        move.<br>
        July 5th Moved back towards town and took the Roswell
        Factory road. Marched 9 miles without any resistance and
        encamped<br>
        July 6th In camp all my 1st Sergt Hazelton rec&#146;d a
        commission as 2nd Lieut. The rebels are all across the
        river. Our pickets extend to it. This is a good section
        of country.<br>
        July 7th In camp<br>
        &quot; 8th Detailed for picket at 2 pm ordered in at dusk
        and moved to Roswell 2 miles and encamped.<br>
        Saturday July 9th Reveille at 2 am. We were ordered to
        move dismounted to leave our horses in camp. We moved
        thro&#146; the town down to the river. When we found out
        we must ford the river and hold our position until the
        Infantry came up to relieve us. Our skirmishers moved
        ahead and met with very little opposition. A picket of 30
        men was all there was at the ford. We caught 3 o4 they
        said the Yankees were the &quot;goldarndest gelleas they
        ever seed&quot; they would fire and then dive to load,
        then fire and dive under again and I suppose it really
        seemed so to them. We had sevenshooters. The men would
        fire and dodge down. The center was about 3 feet deep,
        very rough bottom I rode across we took a postition and
        built breastworks. But the rebel did not molest us. We
        are 20 miles above Atlanta. A division of Infantry came
        up at dusk and we recrossed and came to camp where we are
        now. Very hard work. Yesterday no breakfast. Ford the
        river &#150; climb the steep bluff and build works. Have
        no news. Have got no mail in a week. Love to all<br>

        August 1st 1864</b><p><b>Dear Father</b></p>
        <p><b>I have not written any letter in some time nearly
        &#150; yes a little over two weeks I think. The last I
        wrote we had not crossed the Chattahouchee River. My
        health is a good as ever. Two weeks ago yesterday our
        Division Crossed the river. Since that time we have done
        a great deal of service and hard work but not much
        fighting. The Next day after crossing we moved down and
        struck the Charleston RR from Atlanta About 12 Miles
        between Decatur and Stone Mountain. Tore up 3 miles of
        track thus effectively cutting communications on that
        line &#150; without any loss on our side. And our Army
        followed up the advantage and moved after us capturing
        Decatur the next morning. Six miles east of Atlanta on
        the RR. In a day or two we started on another raid. To
        Coventry, a place on the same road 42 miles S.E. from
        Atlanta and 60 across to Macon. Our object to cut the
        road farther away and hinder their retreat via Augusta,
        if such might be their intention. We succeeded in
        effecting our object without serious loss. Burnt the
        bridges, tore up the track and burnt ties. Captured over
        200 prisoners, two trains of cars, a large amount of
        horses, mules and cattle. Gone four days. While we were
        gone the rebels pitched on our left which was left
        exposed by our absence, with nearly their whole army, but
        they got enough and too much for them. But we lost one of
        our best Generals. McPherson was killed instantly by a
        volley of rebel muskets from an ambush. His loss was no
        sooner known than our men, maddened rushed like an
        avalanche upon them and drove them back. Our loss was
        about 2000, rebel loss 5000. On the 27th Gen Stoneman
        with his Div from our Right crossed over and joined us
        and we started on another big raid to cut the Macon RR.
        The only line of communication left the rebels from
        Atlanta. Stoneman with his Div moved on while our Div
        made one days march and halted to attract the attention
        of the rebel Cavalry and Keep them from Stoneman until he
        had accomplished his intention. We went into camp about
        12 m. The rebs run upon our pickets. We were ordered out.
        Our regiment put up breastworks of rails and staid behind
        them the rest of the night. In the morning the rebs could
        be seen in every direction around us. We expected to have
        a big fight. Our whole Div was out and built works. Our
        line was like a horse shoe. The rebs around us as soon as
        they found out our whole force was not there they sent
        nearly all of theirs after Stoneman. It is supposed
        Wilder&#146;s men charged them. Broke their line and we
        moved back got in camp yesterday . Our Train will be up
        to day with rations. Our Horses are about played. Have
        not heard from Stoneman. Don&#146;t know whether he is
        successful or not. We expect the mail today &#150; and
        some papers. You have later news from Atlanta, I presume,
        than I have. I know nothing only that we have not got the
        place. From Richmond we have nothing later than the 20th
        July. I got a letter from Amelia[Amelia Potter - his
        sister] last week telling me that George Zwick[?] was not
        expected to live. I am very sorry. Hope he will get
        along. We have had broiling hot weather down here and
        dusty perfectly awful. You don&#146;t know about dust or

        Friday Aug 5th 1864</b><p><b>Dear Father<br>
        The battle is raging on the right of us while I am
        writing. The intention I believe is to take Atlanta
        today. It is about 3 pm. Our Cav Division has been in the
        rifle pits since Monday. Our horses are four miles in our

        and John Gilbert. Poor George nothing has affected me so
        much since I entered the service as the news of his
        death. It seems so sudden and premature and I loved him.
        His family must feel it so hard too. I sincerely
        sympathize with them all.</b></p>
        <p><b>We have been doing hard work since we crossed the
        Chattahoochee. Raiding nearly all the time. Our division

        <p><b>Our Army, the heavy part of it, is engaged on the

        reported to have cut the road below Macon and to be
        making for Anderson and Americus to release the Federal
        prisoners, but we have nothing official. We are confident

        do so.</b></p>

        and I take his place. It was an entirely novel thing to
        me and unexpected as there are three 1st Lieutenants who
        had commissions older than mine. I fill the vacancy made

        two as good officers as there is in the regiment for my
        Lieutenants. In every promotion I have had I have jumped
        from three to half a dozen officers who ranked me and I
        have never been jumped. I do not tell you this in a
        bragging spirit, but merely to give you an idea of my
        standing in the regiment. I have no more responsibility
        now than I had before, for I have been commanding Company
        and responsible for Property some time. It only puts one
        more bar on my shoulder and changes my title. Do not let

        for Milo and found me just returned from a raid down on

        marched out to the rifle pits where we have been since.
        We are guarding the extreme left flank. Our line runs at

        domes. Encircled by its defenses and forts also. Kenesaw

        the most singular formations I ever saw being in truth

        Camp near Atlanta Ga. Aug. 24/64<br>
        Dear Father;<br>
        Since writing we have been in another &#145;raid&#146;
        and it has been the hardest<br>
        one, we ever were on. The expedition was commanded by
        Gen. Kilpatrick, the<br>
        1st and 2nd Brigades of the 2nd Cav Division(note 1) were
        along -- Marched<br>
        all night the 17th and reported to Kilpatrick in the
        morning -- laid in<br>
        camp all day the 18th and rested. At 8 PM moved out, it
        was a beautiful<br>
        night the moon at its full -- and a clear sky. At
        daylight we struck the<br>
        Montgomery RR below Atlanta and commenced tearing up
        track, but as the<br>
        column was not closed up as it should have been, a
        brigade of rebels cut us<br>
        in two for a short time. They opened up on us with
        artillery and shelled us<br>
        rather too close for comfort. We had to cross over where
        the bullets were<br>
        flying thick and fast. We charged over it without any
        loss and formed up<br>
        at a church to protect the Ambulances. The rebels had got
        possession of<br>
        the road which we wanted and the 3rd battalion was
        ordered to advance in<br>
        line and retake it -- which we did in good style but I
        lost my 1st sergeant<br>
        Cole he was shot through the lungs, is alive yet, but I
        have no hope of his<br>
        recovery. The other Co&#146;s had several wounded and
        horses shot. From there<br>
        we moved on across to the Macon RR towards Jonesboro,
        where drove out about<br>
        400 rebels and burnt the depot and took up the track for
        a mile -- had<br>
        orders to stay there until 11PM about that time were
        attacked by a division<br>
        of rebel cavalry. They charged our lines twice but were
        unsuccessful both<br>
        times. After the first charge our regiment was ordered
        out as a support<br>
        for our line and everything again was quiet. You must
        know we were all<br>
        very tired -- when you march all night in your saddle
        without any sleep --<br>
        you would be tired wouldn&#146;t you? Well we were
        resting, I was asleep on a<br>
        lot of &#145;shake&#146; spread over two logs when they
        charged again. it was like a<br>
        thunderbolt I jumped and you ought to have seen the shake
        fly as did<br>
        everyone else to our horses -- but our line stood like a
        rock unyielding<br>
        and now to show his contempt for the rebs, Kilpatrick
        brought out his band<br>
        out to the line and they played Yankee Doodle, Hail
        Columbia and a number<br>
        of others for the johnnies -- no doubt to their supreme
        disgust -- it was<br>
        as much as to say come and take us if you can, but you
        can&#146;t -- they<br>
        thought the had us tight but they were mistaken, for we
        dived out of a hole<br>
        before they knew it and were gone to the east and soon as
        they found it<br>
        out they followed us. Overtook us about 10 AM next day.
        Here the general,<br>
        who by the way is about a match for any body I ever seen
        in coolness and<br>
        impudence, left colonel Murray with his division to fight
        and hold them<br>
        back while he made another drive for the RR about ten
        miles below to<br>
        Fayetteville -- our Brigade in advance -- we struck and
        charged their<br>
        pickets killing some and drove them back -- when the 4th
        was ordered in the<br>
        night to make a big show as possible and tear up a few
        rails while the<br>
        attack was to be made by the 7th Penn and 4th Regulars.
        They advanced and<br>
        charged the enemy&#146;s line but were repulsed with loss
        and our boys were<br>
        obliged to fall back hastily. We had struck two divisions
        of infantry,<br>
        which had been sent there to take us-- you see we had
        struck a snag -- the<br>
        7th Penn lost about 40 and the Regulars 36 in that fight
        -- they charged<br>
        dismounted. Well they drove us back so we had to leave
        one piece of<br>
        Artillery in the ground but not so far but that our
        skirmishers covered it<br>
        with their fire and with some loss we got it back. A
        number volunteered<br>
        to retake it and they rushed down and pulled it off with
        their hands. Well<br>
        shortly we begun to hear firing in our rear. It increased
        and soon we<br>
        found we had their cavalry in our rear and Infantry in
        front -- in fact we<br>
        were surrounded. They were forming to play Stoneman(note
        2) on us &#145;Yanks&#146;<br>
        too -- but Kilpatrick held a consultation with his
        officers and a decision<br>
        was agreed at which we soon found out we were to charge!
        through their<br>
        cavalry and cut our way out -- and here I must say --
        there was no time to<br>
        be lost either -- for their infantry were moving up and
        extending their<br>
        line and every minute made the matter worse. Col. Minty
        volunteered to<br>
        charge with his Brigade. The offer was accepted. We
        formed in column of<br>
        regiments facing to the rear -- the 7th Penn on the
        Right, the 4th Mich in<br>
        the center and the 4th Regs on the left. We held a hill
        yet in our rear<br>
        which hid our movements from the enemy. The 2nd Brigade
        was to support us<br>
        then was to come the command, Artillery, and Ambulances
        etc. with Pack<br>
        mules and all. While we stood there waiting the order a
        man in the<br>
        Regulars was shot dead by a bullet. He stood about 6 feet
        from me and<br>
        although it misses even shot there by random shots, there
        is a certain<br>
        feeling which I cannot tell you of -- when a man stands
        waiting the wind<br>
        which perhaps will send him to Eternity in an instant.
        You never will know<br>
        or feel it until you are there yourself (and I hope you
        will never be)<br>
        there is a sort of instinctive bracing of the nerves and
        an air of<br>
        sternness in a brave man&#146;s looks which soon tells
        you his calibre. There<br>
        is the place to detect a coward --I pity them -- they
        dodge at every sound<br>
        and sight they see like a turkey looking for bugs. It is
        laughable as well<br>
        as sober. Presently you hear the command Draw Saber! and
        then the command<br>
        Charge! -- and away we went. As we raised that hill a
        shower of shot<br>
        greeted us -- but with a yell enough to wake the dead --
        we spurred on to<br>
        their line. Their artillery belching forth grape and
        canister into our<br>
        line. The regulars were directly in front of the battery
        and suffered<br>
        badly. Capt. McCormick and Lt. Sullivan and a file of men
        in their van<br>
        were mowed down by one shot. The ground grew rough and
        stony. On we<br>
        pressed -- keeping up that deafening yell -- our Sabers
        flashing in the sun<br>
        a thousand rays of light -- and as we got within 30 rods
        of their works<br>
        they threw their arms down and run -- but on we go
        dashing over their<br>
        works. The work commences -- they surrender by dozens --
        but many of them<br>
        were cut down without mercy. for my part I could not
        strike them after they<br>
        had given up and but very few did hit them in our
        regiment -- but the<br>
        Regulars slashing right and left and many a poor
        devil&#146;s brains lay<br>
        scattered on the ground. From there it was nothing but a
        panic, their<br>
        Battery we got , spiked the guns except the 12 LB
        Howitzer which we brought<br>
        along. The rest after spiking we tumbled into a ditch.
        They had but one<br>
        Inf. Brigade got in position in our rear but they were
        hurrying up and we<br>
        were just in time -- as we got the order to charge , a
        flag of truce we<br>
        seen coming from the Infantry for our surrender -- but we
        didn&#146;t wait .<br>
        Well we only picked up 100 of them the rest got away. We
        were getting away<br>
        ourselves and didn&#146;t stop to pick up much. The
        brigade we run over was<br>
        Texans. We captured their battle flag. Well we marched
        nearly all that<br>
        night -- camped about 3 AM the next evening. It rained
        nearly all night and<br>
        we were wet as rats. Soon we came to a creek which was
        swollen so we had<br>
        to swim across. Two of our men were drowned there and
        some negroes. I<br>
        came very near losing a man there. He was on a mule which
        floundered and<br>
        kept him under some time but he at last got out all right
        -- were out five<br>
        days and nights and went entirely around the whole rebel
        Army going out on<br>
        the right and coming in on the left. In all that time I
        got about nine<br>
        hours sleep as I calculated<br>
        We received orders to be ready to move out again and the
        rumor is current<br>
        through the camp that the rebels are evacuating Atlanta
        -- at least I<br>

        <p><b>NOTES:<br>
        1)The 'Kilpatrick raid', led by General Judson Kilpatrick
        (affectionately<br>
        called &quot;Kill-Cavalry&quot; by his men), consisted of
        4700 cavalry and 8 pieces<br>
        of artillery with support. The 2nd Division was 2300 men
        with 4 pieces of<br>
        artillery and the 3rd Division were 2400 with 4 pieces of
        artillery. The<br>
        objective was to destroy the rail lines leading into
        Atlanta. They ran into<br>
        Both Confederate infantry and Pat Claiborne's cavalry
        (Sul Ross's Texans, I<br>
        think) sent out by CSA General Hood, who learned of the
        expedition almost<br>
        before it began. The expedition was lucky in that the CSA
        infantry got lost<br>
        on the way to engage Kilpatrick.</b></p>
