		<b>were arrested on the 1st June, 1867, on the bridge crossing the 
		Blackwater from W aterford into Youghal. They were kept in Youghal until 
		the morning of the 4th, when they were sent to the Cork County Jail, 
		being marched through the streets handcuffed like felons. The gallant 
		soldiers, who had distinguished themselves in the late war, were greatly 
		incensed and insulted by such treatment, and communicated with their 
		relatives and friends in this country, invoking the aid of their 
		Government. As Colonel Nagle, writing from jail, says : &quot; This is not 
		exclusively an individual case, but becomes a question of right, 
		involving the liberty of every American citizen that sets foot on this 
		soil. I ask the Government of my country, which I have faithfully 
		served, whose laws I have never violated, to secure to me that liberty 
		which is my birthright, and of which I am now deprived without any cause 
		or plea of justification, by an authority I do not recognizeâ€”a 
		government to which I owe no allegiance, and whose laws I have in no way 
		infringed upon.&quot;</b><br>

		<b>Colonel Warren wrote a statement of his case to the Hon. Fernando 
		Wood, who presented the matter in a very strong light to President 
		Johnson. The President placed Mr. Wood's letter before the Cabinet on 
		Monday, the 20th August, and Mr. Seward was directed to confer at once 
		with Sir Frederick Bruce, the British Minister, on the subject, and to 
		reply to Mr. Wood. In his reply, Mr. Seward said :<br>
		&quot; The subject has already received the attention of this Department, 
		which understands that those persons are citizens of the United States, 
		and that there are no sufficient grounds to charge them with the 
		commission of any offence against the laws of Great Britain ; and has 
		good reason to believe that they have already been, or will without 
		further delay be, discharged.&quot;<br>
		On the 23d of August Sir Frederick Bruce telegraphed to his Government 
		recommending the immediate discharge of Colonels Nagle and Warren from 
		imprisonment, and sent to Mr. Seward a copy of the dispatch.<br>
		On the 23d September, they were removed to Mountjoy prison, Dublin, and 
		on the same day received a letter from Mr. Adams, United States Envoy at 
		London, in which he says :<br>
		&quot; I have been endeavoring to do my best in your behalf, to secure you a 
		trial, if not an absolute release. I doubt not it could have been 
		accomplished before this but for the unfortunate revival of the 
		excitement produced in the public mind by the late event at Manchester. 
		I very much regret the suffer-</b><br>
		<br>
		<b>452 FENIAN HEROES AND MARTYRS.</b></p>
		<p align="justify"><b>ing to which you are subjected, and shall continue 
		to do all in my power for your relief.&quot;<br>
		Colonel Nagle takes the position which every spirited American citizen, 
		native or adopted, must indorse, when he says :<br>
		&quot;I have not desired Mr. Adams nor Mr. West to petition for my liberty. I 
		scorn to receive as a favor what I demand as a right. Aside from the 
		individual, physical and moral injury done me, there is another great 
		question involved, before which all personal matters sink into 
		insignificance. The reputation and character of my country is involved 
		in it. Will the United States maintain its own honor among the nations 
		of the earth by defending the liber- ties of her citizens abroad ? Or 
		are they to De subject to the oppression and caprice of every government 
		in Europe in which they may chance to roam ; deprived of all that man 
		holds dear in life, and no redress V If so, let the fact be proclaimed, 
		that all may act accordingly.&quot;<br>
		Notwithstanding the apparent interest shown by our goverment, and the 
		seeming good faith of the British Minister in telegraphing to his 
		Government, nothing has been done in behalf of the outraged prisoners. 
		The latest intelligence concerning them was conveyed by a cable dispatch 
		of 21st October, stating that they would be brought to trial before a 
		Special Commission, to commence on the 25th, coupled with the 
		humiliating addition, &quot;it is said that the United States Government will 
		provide for the defence of Nagle and Warren.&quot;<br>
		It is full time the people should know what is the meaning of the phrase 
		American Citizen, or if it has any meaning at all, and having a meaning, 
		does it em- <br>

		<p align="justify"><b>brace a distinction between, and a difference of 
		protection to, a native and an adopted &quot; citizen.&quot; If the Government had 
		its mind made up as to what constitutes a citizen and his rights, its 
		Minister and Consuls in Great Britain would no doubt have shown some 
		prompt dignity and decision, when the national sentiment and character 
		were outraged by the wanton arrest and contemptuous treatment of 
		American citizens so-called, both native and adopted.</b></p>
