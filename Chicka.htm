	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: .5in"><b>Henry 
	Albert Potter, was born April 6, 1840 in Starkey, Yates County, New York the 
	son of Edward Coke Potter, a descendent of Rhode Island colonial settlers, 
	and Sophia Welter the daughter of a German family from New Jersey. While 
	Potter was still a youngster, Edward took his family and joined other 
	settlers from Yates County who moved to Ovid, Michigan where he cleared land 
	and began farming. Henry was a school teacher in Ovid when he decided to 
	join the Fourth Michigan Cavalry.&nbsp; Potter joined the Fourth Michigan 
	Cavalry July 28, 1862 as a sergeant in Company B. The first spectacle the 
	brigade was treated to was the body laden field after the battle of 
	Perryville, KY which brought some reality to the young men going off to 
	&quot;face the elephant&quot; as being in a battle was termed by the soldiers. His 
	first major battle was Stones River at Murfreesboro, TN which was followed 
	by the defeat of Bragg at Tullahoma, TN. Potter was promoted to 2<sup>nd</sup> Lieutenant in Company E 
	at this point. One month later he 
	was promoted to 1<sup>st</sup> Lieutenant and transferred to Company H, where he spent the 
	rest of his service time. On August 8, 1863 Henry was promoted for the last 
	time to Captain of Company H. This promotion came just two weeks before Minty’s brigade joined General Judson Kilpatrick in his famous raid to 
	Lovejoy station behind Confederate lines at Atlanta. During this raid Kilpatrick and 
	his men at one point found themselves surrounded and Kilpatrick called on Minty’s brigade to make one of their trademark saber charges. The charge 
	blew a large hole in the Confederate lines and allowed Kilpatrick to escape 
	intact from the encirclement. His last tour was from Gravelly Springs, 
	Alabama, to the battle at Selma where the Union defeated Forrest. The 
	brigade continued into Macon, Georgia and finally was involved in the 
	capture of Jefferson Davis at Irwinsville, Georgia. The regiment was 
	mustered out in July of 1865. After the war, Henry married Kate Gardner 
	whom he had met on a trip to Yates County visiting relatives and became a 
	merchant in Ovid. At one time part owner of a saw-mill and, later, on the 
	board of directors of the bank in Ovid, Henry was a member of the GAR in 
	Michigan. Henry died in New York on July 1, 1935 at the age of 95. Henry 
	played the piano and used to entertain my mother’s beaus (much to her 
	chagrin) by entrancing them with his Civil War stories. </b></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: .5in"><b>
	Amongst Henry Albert Potter’s Civil War diaries, letters and regimental 
	documents which were left to my mother by her mother, Bertha (Potter) 
	Palmer, who was Henry Albert Potter’s daughter, was a book my mother called 
	“Captain Simmons’ Book.” I mistook it initially as something Henry Albert Potter had 
	acquired from someone else. I was principally interested in Potter’s 
	view of the war, and filed it away as an interesting account but not part 
	of Potter’s diary. Upon the flyleaf of this book appeared written either 
	“Capt. W. P. Simmons” or “P J Simmons” [my mother seemed to have not been 
	sure]. My mother transcribed my great grandfather’s diary and letters and 
	the “Captain Simmons Book” and sent these transcriptions to me when I moved 
	to Tennessee in 1994. She then donated the originals to the 
	Michigan State Archives in Lansing.</b></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: .5in"><b>Some 
	years after my mother’s death,  a fellow researcher whose ancestor 
	fought with the 4<sup>th</sup> US Regular Cavalry helped me try to unravel who 
	Captain Simmons was. The 4<sup>th</sup> Regular Cavalry was attached, along 
	with Captain Potter’s 4<sup>th</sup> Michigan Cavalry, to Robert Minty’s 
	“Sabre Brigade”<a name="_ftnref1" title href="#_ftn1"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: Times New Roman">[1]</span></span></a> 
	which also included the 7<sup>th</sup> Pennsylvania Cavalry. This researcher 
	had access to the state archives in Lansing and he kindly consented to go 
	and look at the original “Captain Simmons” book among Potter’s things. After 
	looking at the book, his conclusion was that perhaps the blank book had 
	belonged to somebody named “Captain Simmons” but the writing was that of 
	Potter. At that point I took out my mother’s transcription of “Captain 
	Simmons” book and looked at it more closely. With help from a member of my 
	family who was a genealogist, I had compiled the genealogy of Potter’s 
	ancestors back to 1630 Rhode Island and I was much better prepared to 
	understand Potter’s references to personal friends and family. In addition, 
	I had read several books relating the history of the cavalry in the Western 
	Theater and Minty’s Cavalry in particular. The “Captain Simmons” entry for 
	September 12<sup>th</sup> 1863 removed all doubt as to who authored the 
	diary. That entry told of an old man who talked to the diary author. The old 
	man had come to Tennessee when he was young and, as the diary went on to 
	explain, “as a missionary to the Cherokees from New Jersey – <u>Morris 
	County</u>, my mother’s birthplace – his name is Vale.” Since Sophia 
	(Welter) Potter, Potter’s mother, was born at Schooley’s Mountain, Morris 
	County, New Jersey, the diary had revealed that the author was, indeed, 
	Potter. Several more personal references solidified the discovery and I 
	decided to publish it for others to read.</b></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: .5in"><b>The 
	regular diaries kept by Henry Albert Potter overlap the first part of the 
	“Simmons” book and because this overlap of dates implied the Simmons book 
	was done by someone else I &nbsp;put it aside. Potter was, at the time of the 
	battle of Chickamauga, a Lieutenant in Company “H” in the 4<sup>th</sup> 
	Michigan. Apparently on September 12<sup>th</sup> 1863, Potter realized that 
	his regiment would more than likely be involved in a major battle. Perhaps 
	Potter decided to write more in depth concerning the action than the terse 
	entries he normally made in his diary. On September 12<sup>th</sup>, Potter 
	received notice that Minty’s three regiments were to be reunited again which 
	meant the Sabre Brigade would be together as a unit for the coming battle. 
	Another factor possibly involved was the fact that previously, during the 
	Battle of Stones River near Murfreesboro, Tennessee, the only other major 
	battle Potter had taken part in, his diary had been destroyed when the rebel 
	cavalry had burned several 4<sup>th</sup> Michigan Cavalry support wagons. 
	Perhaps Potter did not wish a repeat of that incident and decided to keep 
	his account of the battle on him as he rode about. At the end of the 
	“Simmons” book are two notes, signed by Potter, the first note states:
	“This memorandum was nearly spoiled by getting wet in a darned rainstorm – 
	but I got wetter than the book did.” The second note states: “Take good care 
	of this book as it contains the act of the battle of Chickamauga and 
	Wheeler’s raid.” </b></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: .5in"><b>I 
	have included the duplicate entries made in Potter’s diary along side 
	Potter’s “Simmons” book entries so the reader can see the change in Potter’s 
	approach to writing his diary on the eve of the big battle. Potter’s entries 
	in his small leather diary stopped on September 12, 1863, and there followed 
	some pages of financial information. Normal dated entries in the leather 
	diary do not resume again until November 10, 1863.</b></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: .5in"><b>
	&nbsp;Lieutenant Henry Albert Potter was in the unique position of being in 
	charge of three courier stations just before the battle of Chickamauga. He 
	had access to the dispatches going back and forth from the various divisions 
	moving towards Bragg’s Confederate Army, which was concentrated just outside 
	of Chattanooga. The Battle of Chickamauga turned out to be a major defeat of 
	General Rosecrans’ Army of the Cumberland. This helps make Potter’s 
	perspective more interesting to read for a Chickamauga researcher. 
	Chickamauga was a serious Union defeat, but it could have been much worse. 
	As we shall see, Lieutenant Potter and his fellow cavalrymen of the Sabre 
	Brigade played a large part in mitigating what could have been the surrender 
	of an entire Union Army. General Rosecrans was also helped by Bragg’s 
	reticence to follow up his victory: in spite of much vehement urging by his 
	subordinates, Bragg did not press Rosecrans during the Union forces' disorderly retreat back to Chattanooga. </b></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: .5in"><b>Bragg 
	was content to establish a siege line on Missionary Ridge overlooking 
	Chattanooga. Bragg then sent Longstreet north to battle Burnside at 
	Knoxville. This action weakened the Confederate forces along the siege line, 
	especially around Lookout Mountain adjacent to Missionary Ridge where 
	Longstreet had been positioned. The stage was now set for the disastrous 
	Confederate defeat on Missionary Ridge, which ultimately led to the fall of 
	Atlanta. </b></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: .5in"><b>On 
	the eve of the battle of Chickamauga, Minty’s cavalry was stationed directly 
	in the path of Brigadier General Bushrod Johnson's Confederate division 
	comprised of Gregg’s and McNair’s infantry brigades. In the early morning of 
	September 18<sup>th</sup>, Johnson moved the troops of his division towards 
	Reed’s bridge accompanied by Scott’s Brigade from Forrest’s Confederate 
	Cavalry Corps and Robertson’s Texas Brigade, which had just arrived into 
	Ringgold. That advance on the Union flank was the opening move of Bragg’s 
	attempt to cut Rosecrans’ Union Army off from Chattanooga.</b></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: .5in"><b>
	&nbsp;Lieutenant Potter’s account of the actions taken by Minty’s cavalry brigade 
	makes for interesting reading. We can see the perspective of a soldier on 
	the field who is carrying out orders without knowing how these orders fit 
	into the overall strategy of the Generals and what effect the actions of 
	his unit had on the outcome of the battle. In the following I have
    incorporated some of my own information concerning the battle along with
    Potter's Diary and Minty's Report of the battle as given in the Michigan Red
    Book account of the history of the Fourth Michigan Cavalry. The italics and
    information inside [brackets]are my interpretations from reading. In this
    manner various sources report the same day's action from different
    perspectives.</b></p>

	Tennessee with 60,000 Union troops. General Burnside had 20,000 Union troops 
	in Kingston, Tennessee west of Knoxville. General Bragg had 37,000 
	Confederate troops in Chattanooga and its surrounding area. The Confederates 
	and the Union each had 12,000 cavalrymen at their disposition. On the August 
	29<sup>th</sup> 1863 Rosecrans’ Union forces began to move across the 
	Tennessee River in force south of Chattanooga threatening to cut off Bragg 
	from his supplies. By September 8<sup>th</sup> the Union Army was across the 
	Tennessee. Belatedly, Bragg moved the Confederate Army south to face the 
	threat posed by Rosecrans. Faced with the potential loss of his supply 
	lines, Bragg withdrew his troops from Chattanooga which allowed the Union 
	troops to enter the town. Bragg then began to concentrate his forces 
	opposite Rosecrans to the south of Chattanooga. </i></b></p>

	<b><i>Minty’s brigade positions: In August Minty’s Sabre Brigade had been sent 
	out to demonstrate north of Chattanooga in a plan to convince Bragg that 
	Rosecrans’ Union Army was heading north of Chattanooga. Meanwhile, Rosecrans 
	was crossing the Tennessee River south of Chattanooga. This ruse worked 
	initially as Bragg had placed most of his troops in anticipation of an 
	attack to the north. On September 1<sup>st</sup> Minty ordered the 4<sup>th</sup> 
	Michigan to setup a courier line to the north between Rosecrans and 
	Burnsides. On September 2<sup>nd</sup> Minty reported that Confederate 
	troops opposing Union General Burnside were leaving the Kingston area and 
	heading south towards Chattanooga. While the 7<sup>th</sup> Pennsylvania and 
	the 4<sup>th</sup> US Regulars were on reconnaissance, the 4<sup>th</sup> 
	Michigan Cavalry was on courier duty between Chattanooga and Rosecrans’

	and Bragg’s Atlanta supply lines.</font></i></b></p>

	assignments and told to report to Union General Thomas Crittendon. On 
	September 15<sup>th</sup> Minty was sent across Reed’s Bridge into Pea Vine 
	Valley on the road to Ringgold, Georgia. Minty discovered that Confederate infantry forces were growing in 
	strength to the north on Rosecrans’ left flank. On 
	September 16<sup>th</sup> Minty warned Crittendon, but Crittendon felt Minty was 
	exaggerating the strength of the enemy forces accumulating at Ringgold. 
	This was a critical report made by Minty for if the Confederates were able 
	to flank Rosecrans and retrieve Chattanooga, the roles would have been 
	reversed and Rosecrans would be cut off from his Federal supply lines from 
	central Tennessee. </i></b></p>

	Alexander’s Bridge the next bridge crossing Chickamauga Creek south of 
	Reed’s Bridge. Minty noted this move with approval. Wilder was a brave 
	commander with good sense and Minty's right flank was now protected. Minty's Sabre Brigade and 
	Wilder's Lightning Brigade had fought together before and 
	each had confidence in the other. On the early morning of September 18<sup>th</sup> 
	Minty reported that infantry was moving in force towards Minty's position 
	from Ringgold.&nbsp; Minty’s forward position in Pea Vine Valley quickly 
	became untenable. 
	By the noon Minty was forced back across Reed’s Bridge. Colonel Wilder at 
	Alexander’s Bridge came under infantry attack but in smaller troop 
	concentrations than those attacking Minty at Reed’s Bridge. Minty became 
	concerned that his defense of 
	Reed’s Bridge would cause Johnson to veer northwards to Dyer’s Bridge. Minty 
	requested aid from Wilder. 
	Wilder sent a regiment and 7 companies along with an artillery battalion to 
	assist Minty. Minty stationed Wilder’s troops at Dyer’s Bridge and with 
	Wilder protecting both Minty's left and right flanks Minty devoted his entire 
	attention to delaying a Confederates crossing at Reed’s Bridge. Minty was

	Stable Call was blown – we unsaddled and fed our horses – at 10 am I was 
	&gt;&gt;ordered to go out with my company under Captain Pritchard of “L” Co. and 
	reinforce the 7<sup>th</sup> Penna – as word was sent in they were attacked 
	by a heavy force of the enemy – before we were ready to move “<u>Boots</u> 
	and <u>Saddles</u>” blew at Brigade Hdqrs – but H &amp; L Co’s were in the 
	advance when we came up, there was considerable skirmishing. I was ordered 
	to move to the right to prevent a flank movement – moved down in the camp we 
	occupied the first night - &amp; farther on into a road where we had a view of 
	the rebel line. They were in strong force – artillery was plainly visible in 
	the road – a strong flanking party of the rebels moved to our right – when I 
	was ordered to fall back as the 4<sup>th</sup> Regulars were on the Right – 
	moved back &amp; joined the Battalion – we then rode into a cornfield on our 
	right &amp; on a hill – to support our artillery. From that view I could see 
	clouds of dust a heavy column coming towards&nbsp; us on the left – our guns 
	presently opened up on them – we were answered promptly by the rebels with 
	four pieces – I could see them when they loaded, as soon as the smoke 
	cleared away – order came to fall back – which we did – rejoined the 
	regiment &amp; moved through the woods – our skirmishers soon saw the rebels 
	infantry – we dismounted half of the men and moved upon them – a smart 
	skirmish ensued – but were obliged to fall back by overpowering numbers – 
	formed in line again – again were driven back – passed thro’ our camp and 
	past the “Regulars” – towards the river – which we succeeded in crossing 
	without loss. Formed in a line to cover the retreat of the 4<sup>th</sup> 
	[Regulars] presently crash! Came the artillery in the midst of us – a shell 
	passed a few feet over my head &amp; wounded one of my men seriously &gt;&gt;Chas Hall 
	and two horses. We broke to the right under the cover of the woods – here 
	Captain Pritchard was wounded in the arm by a shell – again we formed to 
	fight on foot, sending the men towards &amp; along the river – from the left 
	where I was sent to watch for them I saw three separate lines of their 
	infantry move from the left &amp; swing around &gt;&gt;towards the bridge – I sent 
	word to Major Gray to that effect &amp; he moved the regiment back once more 
	into a piece of woods skirmishing all the time. Wilders force was in our 
	rear but Col. Minty received orders from Gen Wood to fall back to Gordons 
	Mills which we did, by five o’clock. The enemy following us closely &amp; firing 
	in our rear – at dusk heavy skirmishing was heard on the road we came in on 
	– we went out there – Our Regiment – to support the 59<sup>th</sup> Ohio &amp; 
	the 44<sup>th</sup> Indiana infantry. A sharp fight took place, the darkness 
	putting an end to the day’s work – we remained as pickets during the night – 
	the men suffered from cold &amp; hunger not a mouthful since breakfast – such a 
	cold night is seldom felt at home in Sept.</p>

	General Thomas was known from that point forward as “The Rock of Chickamauga.” Thomas’

	<b>Minty's Brigade Postitions: On September 23rd Minty remounted his brigade 
	and reported to General Crook at what is now called Old Washington, 
	Tennessee. On September 25<sup>th</sup> Reports were received that 
	Confederate Cavalry General Wheeler, with 8000 horsemen in his command, was 
	going to cross the river at Cotton Port on the Tennessee River and attack 
	the Union supply lines. Minty was ready immediately to take on Wheeler while 
	he was still crossing the river. Crook would only allow Minty to send one battalion<a name="_ftnref5" title href="#_ftn5"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: Times New Roman">[5]</span></span></a> to Cotton Port over Minty’s objected 
	wanting to send his 
	brigade in force and stop Wheeler before he could get loose in Tennessee. A 
	battalion (Companies H &amp; F) of 4<sup>th</sup> Regulars went with Captain McCormick in command. 
	McCormick reported back that the enemy had made a landing on the west 
	bank of the river. Minty saddled his brigade in readiness and went to 
	division headquarters and indicated he was ready to ride to the attack with 
	his brigade. Inexplicably General Crook ordered two more companies be 
	sent, in this case from the 4<sup>th</sup> Michigan under Major Horace Gray. 
	Gray reported back that he was out numbered ten to one. Minty sent out couriers 
	to recall the two commands but they were not able to get through the 
	Confederate lines set up around Wheeler at Cotton Port. Minty then 
	asked to go and rescue the men and Crook refused him. This was an 
	inauspicious beginning for Minty and Crook’s relationship. Minty was livid 
	that 
	Crook had decided to leave Minty’s two small commands to their fate. 
	Fortunately on September 
	26<sup>th</sup> the two battalions returned to camp with a harrowing tale 
	of being surrounded by Wheeler’s men, but they had made an &quot;almost 
	miraculous escape&quot; from their predicament. </b></p>

	one battalion instead of an all-out attack on Wheeler with the Sabre Brigade 
	and this disagreement must be considered a factor when later Colonel Minty was arrested on October 7<sup>th</sup> for not following orders and

	<b>Minty's Brigade Positions: The next two entries concern Minty’s failure 
	to support General Crook on October 6<sup>th</sup> against Wheeler. The small phrase 
	“everything in advance of us” indicates that, perhaps, Potter was aware of 
	the fact they had missed a battle. And his statement about the fact that 
	General Wilder “did the most at least” again looking back in hindsight may 
	be indicative of Minty’s shirking of his duty under the pretense he did not 
	receive proper orders to advance. The court martial later cleared Minty of 
	all charges when he was able to show that no orders were given directly to 
	his regiment, but it is probable that this incident on his record, added to 
	his non West Point education kept Minty from his coveted promotion to 
	Brigadier General during the war. It is clear in Potter’s diary entry of 
	October 9<sup>th</sup> where Potter stands on the issue when he remarks that

			Sobriquet given by General Rosecrans to Minty’s brigade as a result 
			of a saber charge through the enemy made at Shelbyville, Tennessee. 
			A brigade is composed of three or more regiments. Each regiment has 
			10-12 companies. Several companies can form a battalion. Each layer, 
			company, battalion, regiment, brigade etc. has a set of officers in 
			command.</div>

			I have not gone into great detail as to the complex maneuvering that 
			took place by the armies as they fought at Chickamauga. For those 
			wishing to understand the Battle of Chickamauga in depth, I 
			recommend Peter Cozzens’ detailed account in his amply footnoted 
			history of the battle in “This Terrible Sound” published by the 
			University of Illinois Press in 1992. The importance of Minty’s 
			stand at Reed’s Bridge is explained in detail by Cozzens. Another 
			very interesting and detailed book on Minty’s Cavalry is Rand 
			Bitter’s “Minty And His Cavalry” a fine well-researched book 
			published by the author.</div>

			In the duplicate entries made by Potter for his two diaries kept 
			until September 12<sup>th</sup>, it is interesting to see the 
			difference between the original terse diary entries and the more 
			elaborate entries made later after Potter realized the importance of 
			the battle that was about to occur and began to describe more fully 
			the actions of his command leading up to the battle. It is 
			reasonable to assume that for the days where Potter duplicates in 
			the Simmons Book his leather diary entries from the 9<sup>th</sup> 
			to the 12<sup>th</sup> that these entries are made after the fact, 
			Potter having gone back to tell more fully the events of those three 
			days that he considered important leading up to the battle he was 
			sure was brewing in the woods along Chickamauga Creek.</div>

			This escape story is based on Minty’s recounting many years later of the 
			events made years after the incident (quoted by Rand Bitter: 
			pp138-139), <u>Minty and His Cavalry</u> (Michigan 2006). Lt Edward L 
			Tucker, mentioned as wounded during this event, died of his wounds October 7, 1863. Potter’s diary contains 
			nothing about the escape of Major Horace Gray and his 4<sup>th</sup> 
			Michigan troops. Potter’s diary entry for September 30<sup>th</sup> 
			indicates that a skirmish took place on September 30<sup>th</sup> 
			and this entry states that he was in the 4<sup>th</sup> Michigan 
			battalion under Gray. Although Potter mentions a skirmish, the date 
			was 
			four days after the date (Sept 26) that Minty indicated for Major Gray’s return 
			into camp. From having read Potter’s diary, letters etc. it is 
			odd such an “almost miraculous escape” took place and Potter 
			didn’t know of it or mention it. Minty in his retelling of the event 
			indicates that two battalions of the 4th Michigan and one battalion 
			of the 4th Regulars had been cut off. Captain James Larson in his 
			book on the 4<sup>th</sup> US Regulars 
			tells the story (also quoted by Rand Bitter) and it is likely that Larson is Minty’s 
			source. Having read Larson's book I am not inclined to doubt Larson 
			whose style is not one of embellishment. The incident must have 
			happened to the Fourth Regulars under McCormick and perhaps one 
			company of the 4th Michigan under Gray. Joseph Vale writing the history of the brigade after the war does not mention the 
			incident (<u>Minty and the 
			Cavalry</u> – Harrisburg, 1886). “Michigan in the War” on&nbsp; p. 657 does mention Wheeler’s 
			repulse of Major Gray on September 30<sup>th</sup>&nbsp; indicating 
			that Gray 
			was attempting to aid the 4<sup>th</sup> US regulars and that may 
			mean that only the 4<sup>th</sup> Regular battalion under McCormick, 
			sent out earlier on the 26<sup>th</sup>, participated in the “almost 
			miraculous escape” and, if no 4th Michigan cavalry were involved, 
			that might explain why Potter did not mention it.</div>
