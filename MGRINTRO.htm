<blockquote>
  <blockquote>
    <p><b style="mso-bidi-font-weight:normal">Salvador
    "Salvio" Romaguera</b> was born in Castel d'Aro, Girona, Catalunya,
    España about 1794. His parents are unknown due to burning of the Santa María
    Roman Catholic church records in Castel d'Aro during the a civil war
    between Catalunya's independence movement and royal Spanish troops. Salvio
    married Antonia Pruneda from the neighboring village of Montrás in Girona. <span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;</span>Salvio
    and Antonia were married somewhere before 1823, which is the date of the
    birth of the first documented child, Narcisco Romaguera.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
    </span><o:p>
    </o:p>
    </p>
    <p><b style="mso-bidi-font-weight:normal">Antonia Pruneda</b>
    was born September 26, 1796 as documented in the records of San Esteban
    Roman Catholic Church in Montrás. She was the daughter of Melchior Pruneda
    and Gertrude Cama. The records of Antonia’s paternal ancestry have been
    traced back to the early 1600s in Palamós, Girona Where a baptism was
    performed at Santa Eugenia Roman Catholic Church in Palamós in May of 1680
    that registered the parents and grandparents of one Engracia Carbó who
    married Anton Pruneda presumed born around 1675. The records of Antonia’s
    maternal ancestry have been traced back to Baptista Vadell and María, his
    wife, in 1670s presumably from the town of Geltrú, Girona. <o:p>

        born about 1823 in Castel d’Aro. He married <b style="mso-bidi-font-weight:normal">María
        Plá</b> in at the Roman Catholic Church Sant Feliú de Guixols in the
        town of the same name on July 7, 1855. Only one child is found from this
        marriage, a girl named Madrona Romaguera who was Baptized in Sant Feliú
        de Guixols on December 29, 1856. Narciso is shown in Estele Cifre de
        Loubriel’s Catalanes living in Puerto Rico living in Guayama, Puerto
        Rico in 1850 and is listed as married and a carpenter. <span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;</span>María
        Plá would be expected to be listed in Loubriel, also, but is not. There
        is no reason to suspect Loubriel’s Narciso that this is not the son of
        Salvio based on the other members of the Salvio Romaguera family found
        in Guayama. Their child <b style="mso-bidi-font-weight:
normal">Madrona Romaguera</b> married Pedro Tarinas in Sant Feliú de Guixols on
        July 23, 1876 which indicates the possibility that María Plá and her
        daughter remained in, or returned to, Sant Feliú de Guixols. No other

        Catalá which was Pere Miquel. He married Ana Roura in Guayama Puerto
        Rico in 1862.<br>
        <b style="mso-bidi-font-weight:normal">Ana Roura y Tort </b>was born in
        Sant Feliú de Guixols a few days before her baptismal ceremony which
        took place in Sant Feliú de Guixols on <span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;</span>December
        4, 1878. Ana’s brother Felix Roura, at age 15, in 1834, came to work
        at Café Comercio in Ponce, Puerto Rico, which was a business his cousin
        Pedro Tort owned in Ponce. <span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;</span>Whether
        Pedro Miguel knew Ana Roura from Sant Feliú de Guixols or that met her
        in Puerto Rico is not known. Pedro Miguel and Ana had six children: <b style="mso-bidi-font-weight:normal">Victoria</b>
        born first may have died as an infant, <b style="mso-bidi-font-weight:normal">Pedro</b>

        born 1875. The majority of the Romaguera’s living in Puerto Rico are

  The Indexed Pedegree File at some point as one traces way back in time,
  becomes a
  historical construct of royal succession or in some cases enters into a fantasy such
  the genealogy of the gods. In this file there are found flights of
  fancy taken by many people as they trace their ancestors back trying to make a
  connection to the royal houses of Europe and beyond. There are a few of those
  mixed in here that I know of where I felt it would be fun to trace my lines back to King
  Priam or Julius Caesar. There are others whose data I am using who probably
  did the same to arrive at their own personal goal. Where there is a known, disputed, connection my
  notes in the original gedcom,
  which are in my personal database and not given here, say so. My sources
  are my personal library of genealogy books, various databases from the
  internet, for example, the gigantic Royal Directory of Genealogy by Brian Tomsett
  at the University of Hull website in England or Paul Bailey McBride´s
  ancestry pedegrees at Rootsweb, and a multitude of others some of which have disappeared over the years I have been doing this research.</font></b></p>
