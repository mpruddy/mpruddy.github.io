	Letter copies received from Ball State University of Muncie, Indiana of 3 
	KKK warning letters to residents of Attalla, AL ca 1870.&nbsp; Typed description

	&quot;KU KLUX KLAN ---1870 <br>
	<br>
	These three warning letters of the Ku Klux Klan, addressed to three citizens 
	of Attalla, Alabama, came into the possession of a gentleman who was present 
	at the proceedings, held at Patona, Alabama, against members of the Klan 
	because of the supposed killing by its order of one, Luke, a white school 
	teacher, near Cross Plains, Alabama. <br>
	There are: Three (crossed out and &quot;One&quot; written above) warning letter(s) <br>
	A photograph of two members dressed in the Klan regalia <br>
	A booklet, the &quot;Prescript,&quot; of the secret rituals and by laws of the * 
	(symbol) *. <br>
	Note that in the booklet, the Klan is never identified by name, but always 
	by the symbols: <br>
	* (symbol) *.&nbsp; The letters are all concerned with an interference in an 
	election, a charge which was generally leveled against the Klan, and each 
	was dispatched in the customary manner,&nbsp; - &quot;SBAN&quot;, (Sent by a nigger).&nbsp; The 
	material listed was in the possession of the original holder, above 
	mentioned, since 1870.&quot; <br>

		Ms. Felch,<br>
		<br>
		Thank you for your inquiry regarding the KKK's letter to James Conn. The 
		letter we have is a single-page photocopy of the original with its 
		envelope.&nbsp; It is part of a three-letter group sent by the KKK to men in 
		Attalla before the 1870 election.&nbsp; All are warnings to &quot;keep quiet&quot; or 
		&quot;do not more&quot; regarding the upcoming election.&nbsp; I would be glad to mail 
		you a copy of the letter to Conn; I can also mail copies of the other 
		letters if you would like to see them.<br>
		<br>
		The Archives and Special Collections Research Center does not charge for 
		fewer than 20 photocopied pages, and there is no charge for postage.&nbsp; So 
		the Conn letter (1 page) or all three letters (5 pages) can be sent to 
		you free of charge.<br>
		<br>
		I do not find anything else in our collection specifically related to 
		James R. Conn or the 1870 election in Attalla, Alabama.&nbsp; The 1870 
		elections were the first held after the ratification of the 15th 
		Amendment, which granted black male citizens the right to vote, and the 
		first black congressman from Alabama (Rep. Benjamin S. Turner) was 
		elected at that time.&nbsp; The KKK was very active before the election, 
		working to prevent blacks and their white supporters from voting and/or 
		being elected.&nbsp; In response, Congress passed an enforcement act in 1871 
		(also known as the Ku Klux Klan Act) to suppress KKK activity. So the 
		Conn letter was surely part of the larger events of Reconstruction and 
		post-Civil War politics.<br>
		<br>
		I hope the above information is useful.&nbsp; Please let me know which 
		letter(s) you would like copied, and I will send them to you.&nbsp; Is the 
		street address on your email the address to which you would like them 
		sent?<br>

		Ms. Gastineau:<br>
		<br>
		I found a listing in your Archives and Special Collections of a KKK 
		letter ca 1870 to James R. Conn in Attalla, AL and would like to see 
		about obtaining a copy of this letter and any other information you may 
		have regarding James' connection to the KKK and/or the circumstances 
		regarding the &quot;election&quot; referenced in the letter.&nbsp; I am a descendant of 
		James R. Conn's brother, Simon S. Conn b/1826 d/bet 1870 and 1880 
		Marshall Co, AL. James R. Conn was b/1834 and d/1899 in Etowah Co, AL. I 
		am researching the Conn genealogy, and would like to have a copy of this 
		historical letter to add to my genealogy files on the family.<br>
		<br>
		Any information you can send me about the method and costs of obtaining 
		a copy would be most appreciated.<br>
		<br>
		I look forward to hearing from you soon regarding this matter.&nbsp; Thanks 
		for your time.<br>

		<br>
		<br>
		Thank you for the copies you sent.&nbsp; I received them the other day and 
		find them fascinating.<br>
		<br>
		I am not sure if you can help me with this or not, but I was wondering 
		if you had read the letters and what you made of them?&nbsp; What I am trying 
		to figure out is concerning the nature of the warnings in the letters.&nbsp; 
		Specifically, I would generally take the idea of a warning letter from 
		the KKK as a threat, but the Conn letter and Pruitt letter sound rather 
		mild, and more of a warning to a fellow KKK member or KKK sympathizer 
		(warning for their general safety), whereas the Gray letter sounds as if 
		the KKK is actually threatening to HARM Gray.&nbsp; In addition, in the 
		Pruitt letter, the KKK makes references to Pruitt &quot;serving their 
		purposes&quot; and sounds as if they respect Pruitt.&nbsp; Is this what you make 
		of these letters? (Basically, my question is are they all threats from 
		the KKK or are they general warnings to fellow sympathizers, or a mix of 
		threat and warnings?).<br>
		<br>
		In addition, the description of the documents provided reference a date 
		of ca 1870, and I thought I might be able to help you narrow that down 
		somewhat. I am not sure if you will want to add this information or if 
		you are already aware of it or not.&nbsp; Online searches revealed that the 
		town of Attalla was known as &quot;Newton&quot; until 21 Feb 1870 when Attalla was 
		chosen as the post office.&nbsp; It was officially named Attalla in 1893.&nbsp; 
		That source was
		<a target="_blank" href="http://www.cityofattalla.com/history.shtml">
		www.cityofattalla.com/history.shtml</a>. And I also found that William 
		C. Luke was killed Monday, Jul 21, 1870 sometime after midnight. "</a><br>
		<br>
		What that says to me, is that since the addres was Attalla and since the 
		letters were produced in regards to the Luke lynching, the letters were 
		certainly written after 21 Feb 1870 and probably written after 21 Jul 
		1870.<br>
		<br>
		In addition, the ADAH website lists a book about the lynching of William 
		Luke by Gene L. Howard called &quot;Death at Cross Plains: An Alabama 
		Reconstruction Tragedy&quot; pub. by the University of Alabama Press 
		(Tuscaloosa) in 1984.<br>
		<br>
		I know you are busy, but if you have time to let me know your thoughts 
		regarding the nature of these &quot;warnings&quot; to these citizens and whether 
		they were of a threatening type or of a friendlier type to a fellow KKK 
		member/sympathizer, I would certainly appreciate it.&nbsp; I hope you will 
		find the information I sent you regarding Luke and the Attalla name 
		useful.&nbsp; By the way, the towns of Patona and Cross Plains, according to 
		that website are in (or were in) Calhoun Co, AL.&nbsp; Today, the biggest 
		city in that county (to my knowledge) is Anniston (Anniston Army Depot 
		is located there).<br>
		<br>
		Thanks for your assistance with these letters. I certainly appreciate 
		it!<br>

		Ms. Felch,<br>
		<br>
		I'm sorry it's taken me more than a week to get back to you again---I'm 
		still playing post-vacation catch-up.&nbsp; But, finally, I've reread the 
		letters.&nbsp; I think you're right about the differences in tone among the 
		letters.&nbsp; The Gray letter is surely more openly and crudely threatening 
		(the handwriting is cruder, too, which is interesting)--one can't miss 
		the meaning of &quot;your neck will certainly feel hemp if you do&quot;--and it's 
		clear that Gray has already done something &quot;seriously objectionable&quot; to 
		make the KKK angry.&nbsp; The Conn letter seems more measured/subtle--perhaps 
		Conn hasn't done anything &quot;bad&quot; yet--but it's still a threat, I think.&nbsp; 
		The wording is rather formulaic, but knowing that &quot;Hell is gasping and 
		the eyes of the Grand Cyclops [sic--a cyclops has only 1 eye, right?] 
		are on you&quot; and being told to do something &quot;or Hell will pay&quot; seems 
		threatening to me.&nbsp; I guess I don't read any indication that Conn is 
		either a KKK sympathizer or opponent, just someone the KKK wants to 
		manipulate.&nbsp; I wonder who Col. Henry Hammond is--knowing might clarify 
		Conn's position.&nbsp; The Pruitt letter may be more a &quot;reminder&quot; to a 
		sympathizer or someone the KKK has manipulated before---Pruitt's 
		behavior has &quot;passed&quot; KKK requirements.&nbsp; I don't know that they respect 
		Pruitt, but they think that he is useful to their &quot;purposes&quot; and that he 
		will cooperate with them if encouraged and reminded that &quot;general 
		retribution is at hand.&quot;&nbsp; So I think you're right about this being a 
		warning to Pruitt to avoid future &quot;danger&quot; by continuing to behave as 
		the KKK desires.<br>
		<br>
		All that, of course, is only my reading of the letters, and I don't have 
		any local context to put them in.<br>
		<br>
		I added your information about Attalla and dating the letters to our 
		files.&nbsp; Thank you very much for that information.<br>
		<br>
		Thank you again for your interest in our materials.<br>

		<p align="center">&nbsp;</p>
		<p align="justify"><b><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Within 
		one of the emails is the below little blurb about my interest/connection 
		to the Conns. To be more specific, my ggg grandfather is Simon S. Conn 
		(1826-bet 1870 and 1880 m/Alsrey Gentry (1830-ca Nov 1879?), and his 
		brother was James R. Conn (1834-1899). Their parents are Joseph and 
		Hannah Conn. Joseph b/ca 1805-d/bet 1867-1870 and Hannah was b/ca 1807, 
		d/aft 1880. I have been unable to find the exact dates of death and 
		places of burial of Simon, Alsrey, Joseph and Hannah. Joseph is my 
		earliest known Conn ancestor. The Conns and Gentrys were in Cherokee Co, 
		GA in 1850 and in St. Clair Co, AL by about 1857. St. Clair County 
		borders Etowah County, AL and many of my ancestors from the area either 
		lived along the county line or moved from one to the other. With regards 
		to the Conns, there were many Conns in Cherokee Co, GA in/around 1850 
		and several came to the same general vicinity about the same time frame. 
		I suspect either brothers or cousins to Joseph, but I have not been able 
		to determine one way or another for sure. (In fact, there is a Simean A 
		b/1824 who often seems to get confused with my Simon S.). <br>
		<br>
		With Alsrey Gentry, I am pretty certain her brother was the Elisha E. 
		Gentry who married Elizabeth Conn about the same time as Simon and 
		Alsrey married, also in Cherokee Co, GA. They are living next door to 
		Simon and Alsrey in 1850. But I have no clue as to Alsrey's parents or 
		any other siblings. There are several Gentry families in Cherokee, but 
		none that indicate a possible kinship to Alsrey. I long thought 
		Elizabeth was Simon' sister, but such does not appear to be the case. 
		Elisha's second wife was Sarah Ann Conn, and it looks like in 1860 they 
		were in Guntersville in Marshall Co, AL, then went to Stephens Co, TX.
		<br>
		<br>
		In a futile attempt to find something to help in my Conn dead ends, 
		periodically I try a shot-in-the-dark regular search engine, trying to 
		concentrate on the more unusual names (Alsrey Gentry is a good one) or 
		possibly a more distant relative that I might not have searched for 
		before. From what I can recall, I literally stumbled upon this 
		information with such a search, though I cannot recall if I was 
		searching for James R. Conn specifically or Conn+Alabama. <br>
		<br>
		The information was very interesting, but unfortunately, other than a 
		few cursory internet searches (giving me the information I provided to 
		you), I have not really done any real digging on the information. I 
		actually acquired the information in 2005, but I just happened to think 
		of it out of the blue the other day when I got an email from a distant 
		Conn cousin that I had not corresponded with in several years. HE is a 
		direct descendant of James R. Conn, and, needless to say, he was very 
		excited to get the new information. (It was also exciting to be able to 
		provide such fascinating and rare information that such a more 
		experienced researcher did not already have). <br>
		<br>
		In any case; working from me back, here is my direct Conn line:<br>
		Briana Smith Felch - Mickey Smith and Mary Brothers - Homer Ervin 
		Brothers and Bertie Elvira Galloway - Charles Columbus Brothers and 
		Commella Grace Conn - Simon S. Conn, Jr. and Eliza Jane Lee - Simon S. 
		Conn, Sr. and Alsrey Gentry - Joseph Conn and Hannah (LNU).<br>
		<br>
		James R. Conn was b/27 Jun 1834, Cherokee Co, GA d/4 Aug 1899 Gallant, 
		Etowah Co, AL, and buried at Bethlehem Primitive Baptist Church, 
		Gallant, Etowah Co, AL. He married Sarah Sallie (Rogers or Suggens); 
		some contradictions there with her last name). Sallie was b/6 Feb 1832, 
		Cherokee Co, GA and d/17 Oct 1915, Gallant. James was a grocer and a tax 
		assessor in Gallant. I don't know he ever fought in the Civil War. If I 
		am not mistaken, it was their brother John B Conn who enlisted and 
		served in Co G, 58th Alabama. (John B may also be found as John S or 
		John D, some discrepancies there as well). <br>
		<br>
		As a side note, Eliza, Simon Jr, Col. William Carroll Lee, and 3rd wife 
		Sarah P. Taylor are buried at the Lee Cemetery in Gallant, Etowah Co, AL 
		(right outside Attalla, AL). Eliza Jane Lee's father, Col. William 
		Carroll Lee, Sr. was in the War of 1812 and Creek Indian Wars. His son, 
		Polk Dallas Lee, was the Sheriff of Etowah County, Alabama between 
		1872-1876, and in 1880. Polk Dallas Lee was in Co A, 10th Alabama 
		Infantry during the Civil War. Col. William Carroll Lee, Sr. was son of 
		Judge Needham Lee (1770-ca 1820) who went from Hawkins Co, TN to Shelby 
		Co, AL. Judge Needham Lee had at least 19 children, most of the boys 
		whom fought in the Civil War and many of his grandsons also. The Lee 
		line is detailed in the Memorial Record of Alabama. In addition, I 
		recently found a fascinating account of the Lee and their Bailey 
		cousins' connection in the early 1820's of their involvement in a large 
		counterfeiting ring in/around Shelby County, AL. (It actually spanned 
		several counties, but was largely based in Shelby). Charges were brought 
		against the Judge (Needham Lee) and he seems to have skipped town while 
		on bail or upon hearing he was to be charged. He was never seen or heard 
		from again and no present day researchers have been able to track him 
		down. James B. Bailey is believed to be the also one who ended up in 
		Brazoria Co, TX. There were a lot of James B. Baileys in the family, but 
		it is believed the counterfeiter was either the brother of Judge Needham 
		Lee's wife, the Judge's nephew (wife's side). There is a Lee Room in the 
		Shelby County Courthouse with artifacts from the Lee era and on the 
		Judge. Unfortunately I have not been able to yet visit the Courthouse to 
		see it. The family was very prolific and the men seemed to live to a 
		pretty ripe age for the most part. William Carroll Lee and his clan 
		ended up moving to St. Clair (which in addition to bordering Etowah 
		County on one side, borders Shelby County on the other), but most of the 
		Lees stayed in Shelby County. There is a fascinating history of the 
		Brazoria Co, TX James B. Bailey, who was said to have drunk himself to 
		death and his wife buried him with a jug of whiskey, and he is said to 
		be a &quot;ghost&quot; and of local folk-lore.&nbsp; <br>
		<br>
		Another side note is that Allen Gray who also received one of the KKK 
		letters I sent), I believe is buried in the same cemetery as some of my 
		Conns; in the Lee Cemetery in Gallant, Etowah Co, AL. Allen Gray was 
		b/1827 SC and d/17 Apr 1897, Etowah Co, AL. He married Louiza. Allen 
		Gray was the 1st Postmaster of Attalla, AL &quot;after 21 Feb 1870&quot; according 
		to my genealogy. (I do not show the source of that information). I did 
		not put it together before, but he was apparently Postmaster at the time 
		of the KKK letters, which would indicate his &quot;high position&quot; that they 
		spoke of in the letter. And on the outside envelope, I wasn't sure if it 
		gave the initials/abbreviation T.M or P.M after his name, so it must 
		have been P.M. after all. My connection to Allen Gray is more distant; 
		my gggg grandfather's (John W. Gilliland's) son, Wiley Buford Gilliland 
		(by John's first wife and not my ggg grandmother) had a son named Thomas 
		O. Gilliland who married Sallie Gray, daughter of Allen Gray. Allen's 
		relationship to me does not compute via my genealogy program, but James 
		R. Conn would be my &quot;third great granduncle.&quot;</font></b></div>
