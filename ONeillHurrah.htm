		joined the Fenian Brotherhood organization towards the end of the 
		American Civil War and led two successive, but not successful, Fenian 
		invasions of Canada, in 1866 and 1870. The Fenian Brotherhood was an 
		Irish nationalist organization that evolved in 1858 out of a society 
		named the Emmet Monument Association. The Fenian Brotherhood grew under 
		the leadership of John O’Mahony from 1858 until reached its zenith in 
		1865. </font></p>
		<p class="MsoBodyTextIndent" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 6.0pt" align="justify">
		<font size="4">The Fenian Brotherhood’s objective was to aid 
		nationalists in Ireland to overthrow British rule by means of an 
		uprising of the peasantry. O’Mahony contacted James Stephens, another 
		veteran of the 1848 rebellion, and asked him to form a sister 
		organization in Ireland called the Irish Revolutionary Brotherhood or 
		IRB. The Fenians trained soldiers in the United States for the 
		anticipated rebellion by forming Irish regiments in several different 
		state militias, all the while collecting arms to supply the IRB in 
		Ireland. After a slow start the Fenians were propelled to the front 
		pages of newspapers in the United States after the start of the American 
		Civil War. Many all-Irish state militias converted into Union regiments 
		to combat the rebellion. There were also a small number of all-Irish 
		state militias in the South that joined the Confederacy. The large 
		numbers of young Irish-born soldiers entering the military formed a pool 
		from which Fenian leaders, many of whom were themselves officers in the 
		Civil War armies, were able to recruit new members for the Brotherhood. 
		Recruiting was also enhanced in the North by the belief that, because of 
		Britain’s support of the Confederacy, a war would break out between the 
		United States and England when the American Civil War ended. The Fenians 
		found they could affect Anglo-American relations by threatening American 
		politicians that the so-called “Irish vote” would go in a block to the 
		party supporting their goal of an independent Ireland.</font></p>
		<p class="MsoBodyTextIndent" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 6.0pt" align="justify">
		<font size="4">John O’Neill was born in Drumgallon, Contibret, County 
		Monaghan, Ireland March 8, 1834. He came to America in 1848 to join his 
		mother who had emigrated in 1840. In 1857 he was recruited by the 2<sup>nd</sup> 
		US Cavalry for an expedition into the west and, later, during the Civil 
		War he would serve as a lieutenant in the 5<sup>th</sup> Indiana Cavalry 
		where he earned a reputation as a natural leader while pursuing the John 
		Hunt Morgan’s Confederate Cavalry. Retuning after an illness towards the 
		end of the war he enlisted in the 17<sup>th</sup> Infantry, US Colored 
		Troops as a Captain. After the war was over, O’Neal mustered out in 
		Nashville, Tennessee. While in Nashville, O’Neill joined the Fenian 
		Brotherhood. When the split occurred in the Fenian Brotherhood in 1865 
		between the Senate Wing that proposed an attack on Canada and the 
		O’Mahony Wing that clung to the original objective of providing support 
		to a rising in Ireland, O’Neill opted for the “action men” of the Senate 
		Wing. Although the Senate’s proposed invasion of Canada forced O’Mahony 
		into a feeble and fruitless attempt to capture the British Canadian 
		island of Campobello off the coast of Eastport, Maine in April of 1866, 
		it was O’Neill and the Senate that launched a real invasion of Canada. 
		As a Fenian Colonel, John O’Neill commanded the Fenian Senate Wing’s 
		assault on Fort Erie and the small town of Ridgeway nearby on June 1, 
		1866. O’Neill’s troops succeeded in defeating several Canadian units, 
		including the Queen’s Own regiment, at the battle of Ridgeway. However, 
		the United States government took action and immediately began rounding 
		up the Fenian troops that were to be O’Neill’s reinforcements. Without 
		support, O’Neill’s Fenian “army” was forced to return across the border. 
		The Fenian soldiers who had been captured were later released and had 
		their tickets home paid for by the United States government.</font></font><a name="_ftnref1" title href="#_ftn1"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman"><font size="4" color="#000000">[1]</font></span></span></a><font color="#000000"><font size="4"> 
		&nbsp;O’Neill, after his momentary success in Canada, rose to the presidency 
		of the Senate Wing. But all was not rosy as an internal feud had 
		developed between those who wanted to make another attack on Canada and 
		those who opposed such precipitous action.</font></p>
		<p class="MsoBodyTextIndent" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 6.0pt" align="justify">
		<font size="4">&nbsp;As President of the Senate Wing, O’Neill called for a 
		Senate Convention in Chicago to debate the issue; but, upon perceiving 
		that he did not have enough support to carry his plan through, O’Neill 
		refused to attend the convention and invited his adherents to come to 
		his own hastily-called convention in New York City, where support for 
		another Canadian invasion was stronger. At this sparsely attemded 
		convention O’Neill formed a third Fenian Brotherhood faction. Although 
		he had lost the right of the presidency of the Senate Wing by his 
		actions, he was still the elected leader of the Fenian Military Council 
		and as such was able to call the Fenian “army” to arms and launch 
		another raid into Canada on May 25, 1870. </font></p>
		<p class="MsoBodyTextIndent" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 6.0pt" align="justify">
		<font size="4">This 1870 invasion was an ill- planned and badly executed 
		affair and, as such, had no chance of success other than create problems 
		for the Canadian government that was forced to call up the military in 
		order to repulse the raid. O’Neill was captured on the first day and put 
		in jail in Vermont leaving his soldiers demoralized on the field. Once 
		again the United States stepped in and rounded up the Fenian soldiers. 
		This time Tammany Hall, seeing an opportunity for political capital, was 
		gracious enough to provide the soldiers with railroad tickets home.
		</font></p>
		<p class="MsoBodyTextIndent" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 6.0pt" align="justify">
		<font size="4">O’Neill’s rump party, after rejecting an attempt at 
		reconciliation by the Senate Wing, formed a pact with the old O’Mahony 
		Wing, now under its new president, John Savage. Part of the agreement 
		was that O’Neill would be given a seat on the council under Savage. The 
		old Senate wing then called for a convention for September of 1870 in 
		Cincinnati, where they converted themselves into a ‘new’ organization 
		calling itself the “United Irishmen.” Without O’Neill and unable to come 
		to an agreement with Savage, the United Irishmen, after a two years of 
		frustration, turned over their organization and funds to John Devoy, 
		Jeremiah O’Donovan Rossa and the IRB prisoners, recently released from 
		British prisons into American exile. The exiles arrived in New York in 
		1871 and once again brought hope of reunification of the Irish 
		nationalism. Unfortunately the exiles fared no better in their attempt 
		to reunite the feuding nationalists. Irish-American nationalism would 
		have to wait for the rise of a new organization, called the 
		Clan-na-Gael, to finally gave a unified voice to Irish nationalism in 
		1876. The Clan na Gael rose to prominence chiefly as a result of their 
		successful rescue of six Fenian prisoners from a British jail in 
		Australia.</font></p>
		<p class="MsoBodyTextIndent" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 6.0pt" align="justify">
		<font size="4">After of he failed to achieve a triumph in 1870 Canadian 
		raid, and freshly installed on the Savage Wing Fenian Council, General 
		John O’Neill was looking for redemption. A colorful Irish intriguer 
		among the rebellious French-Indian “Metis” of Manitoba, W. B. O’Donoghue 
		entered onto the scene and endeavored to get the Savage Wing Council to 
		approve an attack on Manitoba, Canada in order to capture British Fort 
		Garry.</font></font><a name="_ftnref2" title href="#_ftn2"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman"><font size="4" color="#000000">[2]</font></span></span></a><font size="4" color="#000000"> 
		O’Neill, seeing a new opportunity for military glory, sponsored this 
		plan before the Council.</font><a name="_ftnref3" title href="#_ftn3"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman"><font size="4" color="#000000">[3]</font></span></span></a><font size="4" color="#000000"> 
		According to O’Donoghue, the Metis were ready to rise up and join the 
		Fenians. The Council, weary of O’Neill in particular and Canadian 
		adventures in general, would have none of it. O’Neill was finally able 
		to secure a commitment from the Council that they would not disclose the 
		plan and would supply his men with arms. O’Neill then resigned from the 
		Fenian Brotherhood and set out on his own and launched a new invasion 
		into what he believed was Canada on October 5, 1871.</font><a name="_ftnref4" title href="#_ftn4"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman"><font size="4" color="#000000">[4]</font></span></span></a><font size="4" color="#000000"> 
		A friend of O’Neill, the British spy Thomas Beach, alias Henri Le Caron, 
		a member of the Fenian Military Council, gladly gave 400 stands of 
		Fenian arms and ammunition to O’Neill and then dutifully informed the 
		Canadian Dominion Police Commissioner, Gilbert McMicken, what was under 
		way giving the Canadians time to get ready for O’Neill and his band of 
		marauders.<span class="MsoFootnoteReference"> </span></font>
		<a name="_ftnref5" title href="#_ftn5">

		<p class="MsoBodyTextIndent" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 6.0pt" align="justify">
		<font size="4" color="#000000">This event, like most activities in which 
		the Fenians were involved, exhibited a bit of the ludicrous. The first 
		oddity we encounter is that O’Neill’s “invasion” apparently took place 
		on United States’ soil. According to General Winfield Scott, it had been 
		determined in 1870 by the United States Corps of Engineers that the 
		international border was too far south and a new survey had been 
		authorized resulting in a new border line two miles to the north of its 
		original location and that placed a Hudson Bay Company Trading post and 
		a Dominion Custom House into the Dakota Territory of the United States.</font><a name="_ftnref6" title href="#_ftn6"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman"><font size="4" color="#000000">[6]</font></span></span></a><font color="#000000"><font size="4"> 
		O’Neill, unaware of this, enlisted a force of perhaps forty men and 
		attacked and occupied the Hudson Bay Company outpost along with the, 
		then deserted, Dominion Custom House. Both of these structures, 
		originally in Canada, were now 1 mile inside United States Territory. 
		U.S. Army Captain, Lloyd Wheaton, who was aware of the survey, was 
		notified at his headquarters at nearby United States Fort Pembina, and 
		responded immediately. All but 10 of O’Neill’s men escaped into the 
		woods without pursuit. These ten men and three of the four leaders, 
		O’Neill, John J. Donnelly and Thomas Curley, were surrounded and 
		arrested. The other leader, W. B. O’Donoghue, was captured by the local 
		“Metis” and turned over to Wheaton. </font></p>
		<p class="MsoBodyTextIndent" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 6.0pt" align="justify">
		<font size="4">Unbeknownst to O’Neill and O’Donoghue at the very moment 
		the raid was going on McMicken was enlisting the “Metis” leader, Louis 
		Riel, to help repel the “Fenians.” The soldiers that were captured with 
		O’Neill were simply released by US authorities who considered them dupes 
		of their leaders. O’Neill and the three other arrested leaders were then 
		brought before U. S. Commissioner Foster of the Dakota Territory who 
		promptly released all of the men on technicalities. O’Neill’s plausible 
		claim that they were not raiders but a colonization party, the fact that 
		O’Neill did not resist Wheaton’s forces, and considerable annexationist 
		sentiment in the Dakota Territory weighed heavily on Foster’s decision. 
		The U. S. Attorney for the Dakota Territory, Warren Cowles, whose heart 
		was not in trying the case, wrote Attorney General George Williams in 
		Washington D.C., presenting a laundry list of jurisdictional pitfalls 
		including the lack of sufficient jurymen among the “railroad men and 
		adventurers” of a caliber that might bring a conviction that would 
		justify the effort and expense of a trial. </font></p>
		<p class="MsoBodyTextIndent" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 6.0pt" align="justify">
		<font size="4">Attorney General Williams then contacted Secretary of 
		State Hamilton Fish for advice. Fish insisted that the men be tried for 
		violation of United States’ neutrality laws. Based on Secretary Fish’s 
		response Cowles was forced to act and Dakota Territory indictments were 
		secured and warrants issued. O’Neill was re-arrested in St. Paul, 
		Minnesota but, continuing this improbable process, the Minnesota 
		attorney general released O’Neill on “lack of evidence” with the result 
		that no trial was ever held.</font></font><a name="_ftnref7" title href="#_ftn7"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman"><font size="4" color="#000000">[7]</font></span></span></a><font color="#000000"><b><font size="4">
		</font></b></p>
		<p class="MsoBodyTextIndent" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 6.0pt" align="justify">
		<font size="4">The final act of this comedy of errors occurred when, 
		shortly after O’Neill’s capture, Captain Wheaton informed his commander, 
		General Philip Sheridan, that fifty British soldiers had rushed over the 
		new border and now occupied the Hudson Bay post and the Dominion Custom 
		House. General Sheridan resented the British Army’s response after the 
		U.S. Army had stopped a “Fenian” Canadian invasion and he forwarded the 
		Wheaton report to Secretary of War, William Belnap, who urged Hamilton 
		Fish to demand the British withdraw from U. S. territory. “[Fish], 
		however, refused to press the British for a withdrawal, claiming that it 
		was well known that the boundary was unsettled and that it was extremely 
		premature to call the occupation of the post ‘wilful trespass’.”</font></font><a name="_ftnref8" title href="#_ftn8"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman"><font size="4" color="#000000">[8]</font></span></span></a><font color="#000000"><font size="4">
		</font></p>
		<p class="MsoBodyTextIndent" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 6.0pt" align="justify">
		<font size="4">Thus came to an end General John O’Neill’s military 
		career and the last Canadian adventure involving the Fenian Brotherhood. 
		Although the Fenian Canadian adventures appear to be more reminiscent of 
		a Keystone Cop comedy than a serious attempts to free Ireland, the 
		failure of any of the raids to spark a war with Great Britain might have 
		been due more to lack of execution than concept. The Fenian raids 
		occurred at a time when many American newspapers trumpeted annexationist 
		sentiment. At the same time the Federal Government, still irked by 
		Britain’s blasé attitude toward Alabama Claims reparations, mulled over 
		annexation of Canada as a possible outcome to British intransigence. The 
		outcome might have been different if the United States had been faced 
		with a successful Fenian raid and a large number of Irish-American 
		colonists flooding into Manitoba, perhaps bolstered by a French “Metis” 
		rebellion.</font></p>

		<font size="4">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; O’Neill spent the remainder of his days 
		promoting Irish migration to Nebraska. One of the colonies he set up was 
		in a place originally called Holt subsequently renamed O’Neill, 
		Nebraska. General John O’Neill died on January 7, 1878 and is buried in 
		Omaha.</font></p>
