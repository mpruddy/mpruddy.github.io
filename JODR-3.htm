		<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><font size="4">In Cork 
		Jail we were treated to all the severities of convict life. Had we been 
		convicted felons our treatment could not be worse. The usual English 
		tactics were resorted to for the purpose of weakening some of us and 
		getting us to become informers on others to save ourselves. A warder 
		would see me, pretend to be a secret sympathiser with me, tell me 
		something very confidential, caution me for my life not to breathe a 
		word of it to anyone unless I wanted to effect his ruin; thou he'd come 
		next day and repeat confidence again, and by and by he'd whisper 
		something very suspicious of the prisoner in the next corridor: &quot;Did I 
		know him well?&quot; &quot;Was I sure of him?&quot; &quot;Could there be anything wrong 
		about him?&quot; or &quot;Was he in a position to do much harm if it could turn 
		out that he was bad?&quot; Then it would very confidentially transpire that 
		that prisoner in the next corridor was day after day being taken to the 
		Governor's private room and having interviews with detective&nbsp; and other 
		agents of the English Government. This game was played on every one of 
		thirty or forty of us who were arrested, and every one began to 
		entertain ugly suspicions of every one else. This game is played by 
		England every time any arrests are made in connection with political or 
		agrarian movements in Ireland; it is England's way for making informers.</font></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><font size="4">We were a 
		few weeks in jail before we were told what crime or offense we were 
		charged with. We were every day expecting to be brought face to face 
		with our accusers in open court, but England did not want any open 
		court, or face to face business with us. She came into the prison one 
		day, opened court inside the prison gates, had her stipendiary 
		magistrate from Dublin Castle presiding as judge to administer 
		&quot;impartial&quot; justice by doing what Sir Matthew Barrington, the law 
		adviser of the Castle, wanted done. It was an important case; Sir 
		Matthew himself was there in person. All the prisoners were brought into 
		a room, and the room was full of us. Sullivan Goula was brought among 
		us, and there he stood shivering, side by side with the man who had been 
		honored with England's knighthood. Tim Duggan was moving up close to the 
		informer, the informer complained to Sir Matthew that the prisoner was 
		looking threateningly at him and asked to be taken into another room 
		till his evidence was required. Sir Matthew sent for extra police; they 
		came and stood between Goula and the prisoners. No matter how bad and 
		wicked a character I may be considered now, the adoration I received in 
		youth was a moral and religious one. I had not till then realized the 
		possibility that any man would go on a witness table, kiss the Book, 
		invent a pack of lies and deliberately swear they were the truth, and do 
		all this to put into jail and keep them there, men who never did him, or 
		anyone belonging to him, hurt or harm. But there was that Goula before 
		me, deliberately swearing that he saw me drilling three hundred men one 
		night, and swearing to other things against me which he never saw and 
		which I never did. All pure invention of his own; all false swearing. 
		But no; it was not invention of his; the invention was Fitzmaurice's and 
		Sir Matthew Barrington's. They had made up their minds to fasten their 
		irons well on me, and they had made up the informer for the work.</font></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><font size="4">This 
		farce of a trial inside jail walls, to which no reporter for the press 
		would be admitted, came to an end on Christmas eve. Denis O'Sullivan and 
		William O'Shea, of Bantry, Mortimer Downing, Mortimer Moynahan, Daniel 
		McCartie and I, of Skibbereen, were indicted for treason-felony, to be 
		tried at the ensuing Assizes in March, and not to be released on bail. 
		All the other prisoners, too, were indicted, but were let out on bail. 
		Application was subsequently made to the Court of Queens Bench that we 
		be released on bail. Dan McCartie, Mortimer Downing and Denis O'Sullivan 
		were released; Morty Moynahan, William O'Shea and I were kept in.</font></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><font size="4">McCarthy 
		Downing, our attorney, kept us informed of the course of events by 
		letter. At first his letters were opened by the governor of the jail 
		before they were delivered to us. He wrote to the Lord Lieutenant of 
		Ireland, who was representing, England in Dublin Castle, and protested 
		against the opening of letters he wrote to his clients, and after a long 
		correspondence on the subject it was acceded to him that his letters to 
		us and our letters to him should pass unopened. But we found out that 
		they were opened all the same. They were &quot;steamed&quot; and resealed; that we 
		found out by missing an inclosure from a letter we received, and the 
		enclosure was traced to Dublin Castle.</font></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><font size="4">Goula had 
		sworn against a number of men in Kerry, too, and several of them were 
		indicted for trial at the Kerry Assizes in Tralee. The Tralee Assizes 
		were to come on before the Cork Assizes, and the Kerry men were to be 
		tried before our trial would come on. Propositions were made to us that 
		if we formally pleaded &quot;guilty,&quot; we would be released on our own 
		recognizances, but this we refused to do. Our prosecutors know that all 
		Goula swore against us was false; they knew we could break down his 
		evidence in public court; our pleading guilty would be admitting a guilt 
		we did not feel, would be putting a kind of brand of truth on the 
		informer's lies and would be periling the safety of the Kerry men. Our 
		attorney approved of our action; he submitted the proposal as made to 
		him, without any advice of his own, and now that we had decided, he was 
		glad we viewed the matter correctly and came to the decision he desired. 
		On his way to the Kerry Assizes he visited us in jail and told us to be 
		in good cheer, that he had evidence secured, which would be produced at 
		Tralee, showing that Goula was swearing falsely in matters connected 
		with the Kerry men, too; that Father John O'Sullivan, of Kenmare, was to 
		come on the witness table in Tralee and swear Goula was a perjurer. 
		Goula swore that before he became informer he had been at confession 
		with Father O'Sullivan, and Father O'Sullivan was coming forward to 
		swear he had never been at confession with him.</font></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><font size="4">The Kerry 
		Assizes came on; Daniel O'Sullivan (Agreem) was put on trial; Goula 
		swore against him, but Father O'Sullivan never appeared as a witness. 
		The first jury in the case disagreed; they were locked in for 
		twenty-four hours. One man named Kenealy would not join the other eleven 
		in bringing in a verdict of guilty. That jury was discharged. Then a 
		jury was packed. Daniel O'Sullivan Agreem was convicted and sentenced to 
		ten years' penal servitude. Father O'Sullivan never appeared as a 
		witness at either of the trials, and we were mad with McCarthy Downing 
		for not producing him. We brought him to account for it. He told us he 
		had good and valid reasons for not producing the priest as a witness. 
		The correspondence grew a little angry between us. We could not see what 
		valid reasons he could have, and he told us he would let us know on his 
		return to Cork. When he saw us next he told us that Father O'Sullivan, 
		before the arrests, had given information to Dublin Castle of the 
		existence of the illegal society in his parish and in other places, and 
		now Dublin Castle threatened him that if be came on the witness table to 
		swear Goula was a perjurer and thus spoil the government case, the 
		government would produce the letters he wrote to Dublin giving 
		information of the existence of the conspiracy. McCarthy Downing was in 
		some hurry the morning he called to see us in Cork jail, he should go 
		away immediately, but would call again in the evening; we asked him to 
		leave us Father O'Sullivan's letters till he would return in the 
		evening; he left them with us, Morty Moynahan copied them, and that is 
		how I have them alive to-day. Father O'Sullivan, McCarthy Downing and 
		Morty Moynahan are dead; I tell no lies of the dead, but I must tell the 
		truth in what I write of the past, that Irishmen who work for Ireland's 
		freedom in the present and the future may have the benefit of my 
		experience in the road they have to travel. The thorny path I set out on 
		is the path all Irishmen have to tread who are in earnest about freeing 
		Ireland.</font></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify">
		<font size="4">Liberty sits mountain high, and slavery has birth</font></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify">

		would hurt the hair of a head of English man or woman. Yes, let the 
		expression stand, &quot;till doomsday,&quot; because till doomsday the praying 
		should last before Ireland could be free.</font></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><font size="4">In the 
		latter end of 1858 a few priests; here and there spoke from their altars 
		about a very dangerous society that was introduced into the country. Men 
		were going around administering oaths and doing other things contrary to 
		law and religion. That Sunday about the end of October or the beginning 
		of November on which the text of the Gospel of the day tells us &quot;give to 
		Caesar what is due to Caesar,&quot; Father Beausang, in Skibbereen, preached 
		on the bad people who were conspiring to take away from Caesar what 
		belonged to him. Caesar's head may be on the coin of the realm, but the 
		coin did not belong to Caesar, it belonged to the man who took it out or 
		his pocket. While the priests preached, the police were listening, and 
		when they went to their barracks they reported what they heard, and 
		Dublin Castle had the reports by next mail. One sprite made himself so 
		officious as to write direct to Lord Naas, the Irish Secretary at the 
		Castle, giving information; that priest was Father John of Kenmare this 
		is one of his letters:</font></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><font size="4">&nbsp;</font></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify">
		<font size="4">KENMARE. October 5, 1858.</font></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify">
		<font size="4">My Lord—Having discovered in the latter part of the week 
		that an extensive conspiracy wee being organized in this parish and was 
		imported from Bantry and Skibbereen, I deemed it my duty at both masses 
		on Sunday to denounce, in the strongest language, the wickedness and 
		immorality of such a system and its evil consequences to society. Before 
		evening I had the satisfaction of coining at a good deal of the workings 
		of the system, and even got copies of the oaths' which I send at the 
		other side for the information of the Government.</font></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify">
		<font size="4">I was led to believe that 700 or 800 had been enrolled 
		here, and some 3,000 in Skibbereen; the former I know to be a gross 
		exaggeration, and I suppose the latter equally so. Before I came out on 
		these deluded young men—the names of some of whom I have—I advised the 
		magistrates of the facts and they, too, have probably advised with your 
		lordship. I have the honor to be, &amp;c.,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </font></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:1.0in;text-align:justify">
		<font size="4">JOHN O'SULLIVAN.</font></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:1.0in;text-align:justify">
		<font size="4">Right Hon. Lord Naas, M. P.</font></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><font size="4">That is 
		the same Lord Naas who was subsequently sent out to govern India for the 
		English, and was slain by the Indians.</font></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><font size="4">That 
		letter, and the letters of A. M. Sullivan published in his Nation 
		newspaper, and the altar preaching of a few of the priests, gave the 
		Government men the alarm, and they made their preparations to squelch 
		the rising rebellion against their rule. The leader of the English in 
		the County of Cork is Lord Bandon. His name is Bernard, and the castle 
		he occupies is called Castle Bernard. But if you are passing it by and 
		talking in Irish to the Irish speaking people in the neighborhood, the 
		name they will call the castle is Caislean ui Mhahoona—Castle O'Mahony. 
		It belonged to the O'Mahonys, but in the time of the confiscation it 
		came into the possession of the Bernards.</font></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><font size="4">This Lord 
		Bernard Bandon is lord lieutenant of the county, and he called in the 
		City of Cork a private meeting of all the magistrates and landlords of 
		the county. At that private meeting an address was sent to Dublin Castle 
		warning the English authorities there that there was a dangerous 
		conspiracy in the county against their rule, and calling on them to take 
		measures to suppress it. Then a proclamation was issued by the Lord 
		Lieutenant proclaiming the conspiracy and offering a reward of £200 to 
		any member of it who would become an informer. They had the informer 
		already in their hands and in training by the stipendiary, Fitzmaurice. 
		The proclamation of reward was posted on every police barrack on Sunday 
		night, and on Thursday night following the arrests were made in 
		Skibbereen, Bantry, Kenmare, Killarney and other places.</font></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><font size="4">After the 
		arrests Father O'Sullivan seemed to be sorry somewhat, at least, he 
		seemed to have some pity for the 'foolish boys' whom he had got under 
		lock and key. He wrote this letter to the Chief Secretary at the castle:</font></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify">
		<font size="4">Kenmare December 11, 1858.</font></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify">
		<font size="4">My Lord—Since I forwarded to you copies; of the oaths 
		that were being administered by the misguided young men, some ten or a 
		dozen of whom were arrested here yesterday, I beg to assure you that I 
		lost no opportunity of denouncing, both in public and private, the folly 
		amid wickedness of their proceedings.</font></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify">
		<font size="4">Nay, more, I refused to hear the confession or to admit 
		to communion any one person who bad joined the society until they should 
		come to me, &quot;extra tribunal,&quot; as we technically term it, and there not 
		only promise to disconnect themselves from the society, but also give 
		the names of every person they knew to be a member. It was rather 
		difficult to accomplish the latter, but I did ; and having thus come at 
		the names of these deluded young men, I, either with their parents or 
		with themselves, showed them the insanity of the course they had been 
		following. Almost every one of those now under arrest have been last 
		week at their Christmas confession and communion; and, though it I may 
		be no legal evidence of their being innocent, to any one acquainted with 
		the practice and discipline of our church, it is prima facie evidence of 
		their having solemnly pledged themselves to disconnect themselves from 
		the society.</font></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify">
		<font size="4">&nbsp;I beg to assure your lordship that since the 3rd of 
		October—the Sunday on which I first denounced this society—not even one 
		single person has joined it; and, had the thing taken root or 
		progressed, I would have been as ready to advise you of its progress as 
		I was of its existence. So completely extinct has it been that more than 
		once I proposed writing to you to remove the extra police force, seeing 
		them perfectly unnecessary.</font></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify">
		<font size="4">Under such circumstances, I make bold to ask your 
		lordship to interfere with his Excellency- for the liberation of these 
		foolish boys—for boys they are. They have got a proper fright, and I 
		make no doubt that an act of well timed clemency will have inure effect 
		in rendering them dutiful subjects hereafter than would the measures of 
		the justice they certainly deserve.</font></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify">
		<font size="4">If they be treated with kindness they will be thankful 
		and grateful, and doubly so if the thing be done at once, and in a 
		friendly and fatherly spirit ; but carry out the law, and you will, of 
		course, vindicate it, but you certainly will have confirmed a set of 
		young rebels in their hostility to her Majesty's Government. I have the 
		honor, &amp;c.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </font></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:1.0in;text-align:justify">

		<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><font size="4">Then 
		Father John writes to an old schoolmate of his, Pat Jeffers, who was a

		<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify">
		<font size="4">MY DEAR PAT—It never occurred to me that the prosecutions 
		of these young men here would come before you so soon; so I was waiting 
		the approach of the Assizes to put before you the part I took in it. The 
		moment I got hold of the existence of such a foolish conspiracy here I 
		advised the magistrates of it, who could scarcely believe me.</font></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify">
		<font size="4">I denounced it at both masses on the 3rd of October, and 
		such a surprise was it on the congregation that they most unanimously 
		voted me either mad or seeking to work upon the fears of Trench, who is 
		still going to all and most unworthy lengths in opposing the convent.</font></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify">
		<font size="4">Immediately after denouncing, a party name and gave me 
		copies of the two oaths. I inclose you. I dreaded him, and to save 
		myself I mentioned the facts to the magistrates. Trench at once sent to 
		me for a copy and, feeling he only wanted to make a call at the Castle, 
		I was inclined not to give it; but then, on the other hand, I feared to 
		withhold it, as he would be but too glad to have so much to tell Lord 
		Lanedowne and the Government.</font></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify">
		<font size="4">The two Simpsons dined with me the same evening, and 
		Richard advised me to send a copy to Lord Naas by next poet, but to 
		withhold the copy for Trench until the post after, and then let Trench 
		make a fool of himself by sending up his &quot;Eureka&quot; to the government. I 
		did that, and see Lord Naas' reply. On the arrest of these young men I 
		wrote to him a letter, a copy of which I send you, and if he has cause 
		he will take my advice. Let him prosecute these lads, and the excitement 
		that will follow will have no bounds. The people are already talking of 
		giving them a public entry—of raising a subscription to defend them, and 
		thus the excitement will be tremendous ; whereas, if &quot;the brats&quot; be sent 
		home at once, all this will be anticipated. I beg of you to do what you 
		can to carry out this view of it. The government may be quite satisfied 
		that, since the 3rd of October, there has been a complete stop to it 
		here; and if any of the unfortunate boys have moved in it since I am not 
		to be understood as having the slightest pity or feeling for them. Say, 
		if you please, what we ought to do, and do what you can for these poor, 
		deluded boys. Would you advise me to write to Sir Charles Trevelyan, or 
		to the Lord Lieutenant, or would you advise a public meeting or a 
		memorial here? My dear Pat, &amp;c.</font></p>

		was on his way to meet you. Had I known so much I would have reserved my 
		letter to Pat for you. About the first of October I had the first 
		intimation of the movement of these blockheads. I denounced it at both 
		masses on the 3rd, and before the evening of that day I had the

		less you make of the whole matter the more you will contribute to the 
		peace of the country in general. Require heavy bail from them, and that 
		bail they will get; but then you will elevate a pack of silly boys to be 
		great patriots and attach a significance and importance to the whole 
		matter it really does not deserve. Great sympathy for the young chaps 
		exists here by reason of their youth, and if you go to any extremities 
		with them, it will not only give great dissatisfaction to the people, 
		but it will confirm the young fellows in their hostility to the 
		Government, whether they be guilty or not. I beg of you, therefore, as 
		you value the peace and welfare of the country, to let them out, either 
		upon their own recognizances or upon very moderate bail, and you will 
		find it to be the moat effectual stop to this very silly movement. I am,

		<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify">
		<font size="4">KENMARE, December 26, 1858. My Lord—Now that an 
		investigation has been had as to the nature and extent of the Phoenix 
		Society, I venture to call your attention to a letter I took the liberty 
		of writing to you on this day fortnight. I have jest read the evidence 
		of the approver</font><a name="_ftnref1" title href="#_ftn1"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman"><font size="4">[1]</font></span></span></a><font size="4"> 
		Sullivan in the Cork Examiner, and he states &quot;He had been at confession 
		with me, and that I advised him to break the oaths.&quot; The man never 
		confessed to me. I never exchanged a word with him. He is not a 
		parishioner of mine at all! If all his evidence be as true as this much 
		it is of little value.</font></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify">
		<font size="4">Looking, therefore, at the unsupported evidence of this 
		fellow, at the youth of the lads led astray by him, and, above all, at 
		the fact of the society having been completely extinguished since I 
		first denounced it on the 3rd of October, I venture again to ask your 
		lordship to interfere with his Excellency for a free pardon for these 
		foolish parishioners of mine, It will be the most perfect extinguisher 
		he can possibly put on it,</font></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify">
		<font size="4">If you call them up for trial a large subscription will 
		be made up to defend them; for their youth, with the innumerable 
		perjuries of the approver, has created much sympathy for them, and great 
		excitement will be kept up here until the assizes. If they shall be 
		acquitted a regular ovation will be the consequence, while a conviction 
		cannot entail a very heavy sentence on such striplings. If his 
		Excellency will graciously grant them a free pardon he will attach them 
		faithful and beholden to her Majesty, and we shall hear no more of this 
		absurd, wicked and foolish society. I am quite sure, also, that you must 
		be aware that it was my active interference suppressed the society so 
		immediately here; and, though I incurred much odium in the beginning, 
		all parties now admit I was their best friend. This, I think, entitles 
		me to some consideration on your part; and be assured that, if I had the 
		slightest reason to think that a prosecution would tend more to the 
		preservation of the peace and the dignity of the constitution than what 
		I ask now, I would be the foremost in recommending it. I therefore 
		confidently seek for a free pardon for the whole of my poor deluded 
		parishioners; because, if the thing be done at all, it ought to be done 
		in a free and generous making no distinctions or exceptions, because, 
		without pronouncing on the guilt or the innocence of any of the parties, 
		I am perfectly satisfied and convinced not one of them had the slightest 
		connection with the society from the day I first denounced it. I have 
		the honor, &amp;c., </font></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:1.0in;text-align:justify">
		<font size="4">John O'Sullivan.</font></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:1.0in;text-align:justify">
		<font size="4">The Right Hon. Lord Naas, M. P.</font></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><font size="4">&quot;The 
		brats&quot; he calls the young men who had the courage to dare all the pains 
		and penalties that England has ready for all in Ireland who dispute her 
		power and mind how he chuckles to his friend Pat at the discomfiture of 
		Trench, who thinks he is at the Castle with the information before 
		Father John is there with it. Writing to Sir Matthew he says: &quot;About the 
		1st of October I had the first intimations of the movement of these 
		blockheads. I announced it at both masses on the 3rd, and before the 
		evening of that day I had the satisfaction of getting two copies of the 
		oaths, which I at once forwarded to Lord Naas, and for which I have his 
		thanks.&quot;</font></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><font size="4">The 
		thanks of an English lord was not much for such an outrage upon the 
		religion of the Irish people, because it was by an outrage upon their 
		religion and upon the character of their clergy that Father O'Sullivan 
		came by those secrets that he gave away to the English. He met in the 
		confessional one of the men who were sworn in, he questioned him, he 
		told the man to go out into the chapel yard and meet him there; the man 
		went out, the priest went out after him, and in the chapel yard the 
		priest got from the penitent a copy of the oath and afterward sent it to 
		Dublin Castle. This was getting it &quot;extra tribunal,&quot; as Father John 
		&quot;technically&quot; termed it, but I never met any priest to whom I told the 
		story to approve of technicality of that kind in connection with the 
		duties of the Catholic confessional.</font></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><font size="4">Sullivan 
		Goula swore when swearing against us in Cork that he was at confession 
		with Father O'Sullivan. Father O'Sullivan in that letter of December 26 
		to Lord Naas says: &quot;The man never confessed to me. I never exchanged a 
		word with him.&quot; McCarthy Downing told us Father John was ready to come 
		on the witness table and swear that, and thus prove Goula a perjurer; 
		but when Lord Naas and Sir Matthew threatened him that if he did it they 
		would produce the whole of his letters and make him swear to them, that 
		silenced the loyal priest. It was his bishop—Bishop Moriarty—that said 
		&quot;Hell is not hot enough nor eternity long enough&quot; for the Fenians. God 
		be good to them, both of them are dead.</font></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><font size="4">Others 
		are dead, too, who did their best when living to dissuade the young men 
		from joining the movement, and to make those who had joined abandon it. 
		To attribute any other motive to them than religious ones is a thing I 
		cannot venture to do. I examine my conscience, I ask myself: &quot;Can I 
		honestly write down anything about Dr. O'Hea, Bishop of Ross, but what 
		is patriotic?&quot; My conscience answers &quot;No,&quot; but it also says &quot;Tell the 
		truth.&quot; Bishop O'Hea, God be good to him, was very strong in the 
		confessional against &quot;the boys&quot; who belonged to the society—he'd 
		challenge them, he'd ask them if they belonged to the society, if they 
		did not confess it as a sin that they did belong to it—and where be 
		found out a member he tried to make him give up membership; if he would 
		not give it up he turned him away from the confessional without giving 
		him the blessings of religion. As I can speak from experience I may as 
		well tell what that experience is; I hope I can tell it without leading 
		any one to think I mean to do anything irreligious. To tell the truth 
		and tell the story for truth's sake and for Ireland's sake is my 
		purpose, and sorry I am I have such a story to tell as this:</font></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><font size="4">Bishop 
		O'Hea was the bishop of the diocese in which I lived; we lived in the 
		same town—Skibbereen. Before he was made bishop he was parish priest of 
		the town in which I was born—Ross. After I was evicted, and when I was 
		leaving Ross, setting out to make my fortune in the world—which fortune 
		is hardly made yet—I got this character from him: &quot;Jeremiah O'Donovan is 
		a smart, intelligent young lad; his conduct up to this has been good and 
		correct; I recommend him as one who will prove honest and trustworthy.</font></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify">
		<font size="4">MICHAEL O'HEA, P. P.&quot;</font></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><font size="4">I am sure 
		he never recognized in the &quot;young lad&quot; to whom he gave that character 
		when he was parish priest the young man who troubled him so much when be 
		was bishop. He was bishop of our diocese when the Phenix Society was 
		started in '56, and when the Irish Revolutionary Brotherhood was started 
		in '58. Our people in Ireland are very religious find they attend to 
		their Christmas and Easter religious duties very regularly. But when the 
		oath bound society was started the &quot;boys&quot; began to fall out with some of 
		the priests and with the bishop too. They found they could not go to 
		their duty without giving up membership in the Brotherhood. I went to a 
		funeral one day to Ross, some twelve miles distant front Skibbereen; on 
		the market square of the town I met Father Tim Murray, who had been 
		stationed in Skibbereen a short time previously ; it was the time of a 
		jubilee, and Father Tim asked me if I did the jubilee yet. &quot;Oh, no, 
		Father Tim,&quot; said I, &quot;I'm outside the pale of the church now.&quot; &quot;How is 
		that, Jerrie?&quot; said he, &quot;Well, we're trying to do something for the old 
		cause; we're trying to raise the Irish Volunteers and the United 
		Irishmen again, and the priests and the bishop in Skibbereen think it is 
		going to upset the church we are, and they're turning the boys away from 
		the confessional.&quot; &quot;Oh, never mind that,&quot; said Father Tim; &quot;I'll be in 
		Skibbereen next week, helping them to finish the jubilee. Come to me and 
		I'll not turn you away.&quot; Then he asked me up to the house to have a 
		lunch with him. I went up and we had a further talk on the subject, 
		Father Tim was in Skibbereen the following week and I went to my duty.</font></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><font size="4">Shortly 
		after that I went to the bishop. I confessed my sins, but never 
		confessed that I belonged to any sinful society. When I told him I had 
		done he began to question me. Did I belong to any secret society? I did 
		not. Did I take an oath in connection with any society to which I 
		belonged? I did. &quot;I can't give you absolution for it.&quot; &quot;I don't confess 
		it as a sin and I don't seek absolution for it.&quot; &quot;You must give it up.&quot; 
		&quot;I must not; I consider it my duty to be a soldier for my native land. 
		If I ‘listed as a soldier or a policeman, and took an oath to fight for 
		England, you would not tell me I should give it up. I consider it no sin 
		to take an oath as a soldier for Ireland, and the priest I was with told 
		me it was no sin.&quot;</font></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><font size="4">&quot;What 
		priest was that ?&quot;</font></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><font size="4">&quot;I cannot 
		tell you.&quot;</font></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><font size="4">&quot;It is a 
		sin and that priest participated in your sin, and go away from me, and 
		do not come to me any more.&quot;</font></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><font size="4">Saying 
		that, he shut the slide of the confessional, and I walked away. That day 
		week, I went to him again. As soon as he looked at me be said:</font></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><font size="4">“Didn't I 
		tell you not to come to see any more?”</font></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><font size="4">“It is 
		not to you I come, my lord,” said I, “but to the confessional. I come to 
		the tribunal of penance to confess my sins, and you there, as a minister 
		of God, are bound to hear me.” He seemed vexed. I cannot now recall the 
		many things he said, but in reply I said: “Dr. Doyle, Bishop of Kildare 
		and Loughlin, says if a rebellion raged from Malin Head to Cape Clear, 
		no priest or bishop in Ireland would fulminate a decree of 
		excommunication against anyone engaged in it.”</font></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><font size="4">&quot;I know 
		more about Dr. Doyle than you do,&quot; said be, &quot;and go on with your 
		confession.&quot;</font></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><font size="4">I 
		finished, and he told me to come to him again that day week. That day 
		week I could not come to him; I was locked up in Cork Jail.</font></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><font size="4">Bishop 
		O'Hea and Father Tim Murray are dead to-day, God be good to them! If God 
		in His mercy be as good to me when I leave this land forever, I will be 
		happy, and God's mercy will be great.</font></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><font size="4">An 
		interview I had one time with Father John O'Brien, who is to-day living 
		and officiating as a priest in the Parish of Ardfield, may be worth 
		speaking of here; it will throw some light upon our subject, and my 
		experience in America verifies much of what he said.</font></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><font size="4">I was 
		transacting some business about town one day, and when I came home I was 
		told Father O'Brien called while I was out, and wished to see me at his 
		house. Father O'Brien and I were black with each other; our families 
		were related or connected with each other someway, but as he was 
		severely down on the boys--scolding them and turning them away from him 
		whenever they approached him on religion—he and I were hardly on 
		speaking terms, and it surprised me that he should call to see me. It 
		turned out that he didn't call at all; it was the 1st of April, and my 
		people at home knowing the coolness between the priest and me, thought 
		it would be a good joke to make an April fool of me by getting me to 
		call upon him. Not giving the April day or the April fool a thought I 
		walked up to the priest's house and rapped at the door. Kitty opened the 
		door, and asking what I wanted, I told her: &quot;I want to see Father 
		O'Brien.&quot; &quot;Come in here, Rossa,&quot; said he, standing at the head if the 
		stairs. I went up, followed him into the sitting room, and sat down. He 
		entertained me hospitably, had a long friendly talk for about two hours, 
		discussed religion and politics, Ireland and England, Fenianism and 
		secret societies in general, and when I thought it time to leave, he 
		accompanied me to the door, telling me to call again and have a longer 
		talk. As soon as my back was turned to the door I began asking myself 
		&quot;What in the world did he want me for?&quot; And as soon as I entered my own 
		door I was laughed at to the cry of &quot;April fool.&quot; But the few hours' 
		conversation I had with Father O'Brien made no fool of me, though he, 
		like me with him, was, I suppose, wondering what particularly I wanted 
		to see him for.</font></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><font size="4">
		Discussing the subject of Fenianism that day, I asked him why he and 
		other priests were turning men away from the confessional on account of 
		belonging to the society, whereas I could go to the confession and not 
		be turned away? The substance of his reply and explanation was this: &quot;In 
		matters of this kind we have a discretionary power, and we deal with men 
		as we know them. The experience of the church with all secret societies 
		is that they come generally to be used against the interests of the 
		church and the interests of religion ; young men are initiated into them 
		for patriotic purposes, and then designing men who have selfish aims 
		generally grow into leadership and by degrees lead the masses to do 
		things that are hostile to religion and hostile to patriotism—even lead 
		them to do things that are hostile to the patriotic purposes for which 
		the society was established. Your case is one of the cases where the 
		father confessor is satisfied you see your way before you and cannot be 
		led into hostility against the interests of religion, and be used his 
		discretionary power in admitting you to the sacraments; but with others 
		who be thinks can be led astray he acts differently and according to his 
		judgment.&quot;</font></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><font size="4">&quot;That is 
		all very well, Father O'Brien,&quot; said I, &quot;but if you know the injury to 
		religion that is done by this work of turning the young men away from 
		the confessional you would use your influence to have it stopped. I must 
		confess to you that I was getting cold myself toward the priests when I 
		see them denouncing us for engaging in a work which I consider the 
		holiest work on earth—that of getting rid of this English Government 
		that has destroyed our language and our land, that has hunted our 
		priests and robbed our people, and made education a penal offense. I 
		learned nothing an my youth but that the Catholic priest was the 
		embodiment of hostility to English rule in Ireland, and when I now see 
		the Catholic priest joining in with England and cursing us for 
		conspiring to beat down the Sassenagh robber, that love for the Catholic 
		priest that was planted in my nature is shattered and shaken. It is part 
		of my religion to work for the destruction of English rule in Ireland; 
		if you take that part of my religion away I have not the whole of what 
		my father and mother gave me, and I grow indifferent; you cannot be the 
		priest of my people's religion.&quot;</font></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><font size="4">Father 
		O'Brien spoke long and earnestly in reply to what I said and in 
		elucidations of the politico-religious Policy of the church—spoke of the 
		three great principals—unity, liberty, charity, unity in essentials, 
		liberty in non essentials and charity in all things; and after a very 
		agreeable interview with him, which is as fresh in my memory to-day as 
		the day it took place, bade him good by. It is in America I get 
		experience of the truth of much of what Father O'Brien said about 
		leadership and about designing men ruining the society for their own 
		selfish aims and ends.</font></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><font size="4">I was in 
		jail when I ended my last chapter. I brought myself out of jail to 
		explain the relations existing between the priests and ourselves; if 
		anyone thinks I have taken too much liberty in speaking on the matter I 
		punish myself by returning to prison.</font></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">&nbsp;</p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><font size="4">The 17th 
		of March St. Patrick's day, 1859, came on and Cork Assizes opened. We 
		were ready for trial. William O'Shea, Mortimer Moynahan and I were 
		brought from the prison to the Court House and escorted to the 
		underground waiting room, convenient to the dock. Here we were visited 
		by our attorney and counsel and counsel for the Crown, and propositions 
		were made to us that if we pleaded guilty we would be let free, a mere 
		formal recognizance of our own personal security for twenty pounds to 
		appear when called would be taken, and that would be the last heard of 
		the prosecution. We would not plead guilty and by and by we were led 
		into the dock. On the bench before us sat the famous, or the infamous, 
		Judge Keogh. Into the dock also came Patrick J. Downing, Morty Downing 
		and Denis O'Sullivan, who had been out on bail. They brought some 
		shamrocks into the dock with them and gave us some sprigs of the 
		national emblem and we put them in the buttonholes of our coats. We were 
		ready for trial, ready for fight, but no fight came. England's Attorney 
		General stood up and asked for a postponement of those cases till the 
		next assizes, as the Crown was not fully prepared at the present, Our 
		counsel opposed the motion of postponement, but Judge Keogh did not seem 
		to care much for the opposition; he granted the motion of the Attorney 
		General and ordered the prisoners to be put back till the next assizes 
		in August. Our counsel applied that we be let out on bail No, Judge 
		Keogh decided that we be kept in without bail; and off, back to prison, 
		we were taken. It was vexatious, but what were we to do? The stone walls 
		were there around us, but it was no use to us knocking our heads against 
		them. There was no case on which to prosecute us, no informers to swear 
		against us — even the unfortunate fallen women of the streets would not 
		come forward to swear they saw us out at night, and so corroborate the 
		swearing of Goula regarding the nightly drillings. We were offered our 
		liberty, and would not take it. Some of our people had no pity for us; 
		they never considered what we considered, that one of our men, Daniel 
		O'Sullivan Agreem, had been convicted and sentenced to ten years' 
		transportation on Sullivan Goula's swearing and that our pleading 
		&quot;Guilty&quot; to get out free would confirm his sentence and put the brand of 
		truth on what Goula swore.</font></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><font size="4">The three 
		prisoners who had been out on bail were to be released on bail again. 
		They came to jail with us, and it took a little time to renew the bail 
		bonds While Patrick Downing was in our company he was telling us of the 
		glorious night he had last night down in Cove</font><a name="_ftnref2" title href="#_ftn2"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman"><font size="4">[2]</font></span></span></a><font size="4">,. 
		A ship had arrived in the harbor having on board nine or ten Italians 
		who had escaped from penal servitude. They had been condemned to life 
		long imprisonment for political offenses in Italy and while being taken 
		in chains to some penal settlement, they broke loose, seized the ship 
		and brought her into the cove of Cork. Patrick met them, fraternized 
		with them and they were up all night till clear day in the morning.</font></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><font size="4">Mr 
		Gladstone—we have all heard of Mr. Gladstone—he visited these same 
		prisoners when those escaped men were in prison. He wrote a book on the 
		horrible, terrible treatment King &quot;Bomba&quot; was giving his political 
		prisoners in the Neapolitan prisons—these very same prisoners, Poeri, 
		Guido and their companions, who had now escaped, and were now being 
		feted in the Cove of Cork, with all England rejoicing that they were 
		freemen under the English flag. And while all England was rejoicing at 
		the escape of the political prisoners of another tyranny, England never 
		gave a thought to the fact that her own tyranny had made political 
		prisoners, too, and that her law, incapable of legally convicting them, 
		had that very same day consigned them back to prison.</font></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><font size="4">Ah, no, 
		it is with England as Mr. Lowell, in his book of poems, says:</font></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify">
		<font size="4">'Tis you're the sinner always—she's the saint.</font></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><font size="4">Gladstone 
		cried down his eyes those times about the treatment those Neapolitans 
		received in Neapolitan prisons, In his own prisons, in the prisons of 
		England, and under his own administration as Prime Minister of England, 
		I showed a commission of inquiry, of which Lord Devon was chairman, that 
		Mr. Gladstone gave worse treatment to his own Irish political prisoners 
		in England than King Bomba gave to the Italians in Naples.</font></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><font size="4">The March 
		Assizes of '59 passed off and left us in jail. Application was made to 
		the Court of Queen's Bench, in Dublin, for our release on bail, and the 
		application was refused. Propositions were again made to us coming on 
		the Assizes in August that we plead guilty and be released, and we 
		refused to plead guilty. The proposal was strengthened by the argument 
		that some of the patriots of '98 pleaded guilty. We replied they were 
		sorry for it afterward; that the precedent was a bad one and we would 
		not follow it. Then we were greater than the men of '98? We were not, 
		but the men of '98 pleaded &quot;guilty&quot; to stop the executions that were 
		going on and to save the lives of innocent men. All promises made to 
		them were broken. They were sent to Fort George, in Scotland, and were 
		not released from there until some years after they had made their 
		confessions.</font></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><font size="4">The 
		August Assizes came on. We were again taken down to the cellar under the 
		dock. Again it was threatened upon us that our case would be postponed 
		to the ensuing March Assizes, and that we'd be kept in jail unless we 
		accepted liberty on condition of pleading guilty'. We refused to do so 
		unless Dan O'Sullivan Agreem, who had been transported, would be 
		released with us. A guarantee was given that he would be released, and 
		we accepted the proposition. We were brought into the dock; there again 
		before us was Judge Keogh in all his glory. The Attorney General said 
		the Queen was inclined to be merciful to these deluded young men, etc., 
		and would concede them their liberty on pleading guilty, and entering 
		into their personal recognizances to appear for judgment when called 
		upon.</font></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><font size="4">I had 
		like to break loose and say something, but McCarthy Downing shook his 
		head at me, and Keogh, addressing the sheriff, said &quot;The prisoners can 
		now leave the dock.&quot;</font></p>
