		Ireland 1801, after the defeat of the 1798 United Irishmen rebellion, 
		England decided to make Ireland a part of the Kingdom of England and 
		removed the Irish Parliament and instead all Irish Members would attend 
		the English Parliament in London. A charismatic Irishman named Daniel 
		O’Connell attempted through legal agitation to “Repeal the act of Union” 
		and acquired a significant amount of support at mass rallies in Ireland. 
		At one point younger members of his following began to feel that if 
		Repeal was not attainable by legal means then resorting to arms must 
		still be considered an option. This did not set well with O’Connell, who 
		did not want to introduce anything into his agitation for Repeal that 
		could bring the British authorities down on him. O’Connell disparagingly 
		labeled these dissidents “Young Ireland”. </font></p>
		<p align="justify"><br>
		<font size="6">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </font><font size="6">Y</font><font size="5">oung 
		Ireland was booted out of the movement and began to form its own 
		organization, “the Irish Confederation” , and at one point chartered 
		instructional clubs to educate Irishmen and make them politically aware 
		of the effects of the Act of Union. One of the members, John Mitchel, 
		was much more strident and wrote rebellious diatribes against England. 
		Mitchel was arrested and deported. The rest of Young Ireland still 
		affirming their right to bear arms if necessary to achieve home rule, 
		were suddenly thrown into a turmoil, when the English revoked habeas 
		corpus and set out to arrest the leaders. Some men from this group, who 
		were later to become involved in a scheme to foment an Irish rebellion 
		against British rule from America, were Michael Doheny, John O’Mahony 
		and Thomas Francis Meagher, and, from France, James Stephens returned to 
		Ireland in 1856 and joined other 1848 veterans who still dreamed of 
		freeing Ireland. </font></p>
		<p align="justify"><br>
		<font size="6">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; T</font><font size="5">he British captured many leading Young Irelanders, John Mitchel, Thomas Francis 
		Meagher, Terence Belew McManus, etc., who reached America after serving 
		or escaping prison sentences; and there were many others, like John 
		O'Mahony, Michael Doheny and Joseph Denieffe, who managed to elude 
		capture and fled to America, principally to New York. Those Young Irelanders 
		who reached America found a freedom of activity&nbsp; they 
		didn't have in Ireland and some initiated or joined small clubs that 
		either trained as militia with an avowed purpose of returning to Ireland 
		to help in a rising, or held meetings where blustering against Britain 
		and devising plans to set Ireland free were standard fare. In this time 
		frame, according to O’Shea in his history of the Ancient Order of 
		Hibernians (AOH), John O’Mahony and other ex-Young Irelanders were also 
		members of the AOH.</font></p>
		<p align="justify"><font size="5"><br>
		</font><font size="6">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I</font><font size="5">n the 
		mid 1850s Michael Doheny was chairman of the Emmet Monument Association 
		(EMA) in New York, a group that intended to attack England during the 
		Crimean war, but when the war ended with nothing accomplished the EMA 
		suspended its meetings to wait for another English difficulty to become 
		another Irish opportunity. EMA members Michael Doheny and John O’Mahony, 
		Michael Corcoran, Owen Considine, Joseph Denieffe and others decided to 
		send out feelers to Ireland to see if there was the chance a rebellion 
		could be generated by the arrival of Irish-American troops on Irish 
		soil. They contacted James Stephens, who agreed to prepare Irishmen in 
		Ireland for a rebellion. Although in concept it was to be a united 
		organization as the outgrowth of the Emmet Monument Association, two 
		distinct organizations grew out of the agreement: the Irish 
		Revolutionary Brotherhood (IRB) in Ireland founded by Stephens and the 
		Fenian Brotherhood (FB) founded by O'Mahony in the United States. The 
		Fenian Brotherhood chose John O’Mahony as its leader and began to 
		collect money and train men. The Civil war interfered with Fenian plans 
		when many Irish-Americans in the Fenian militias joined the two opposing 
		armies. 
		But war brought many young Irish soldiers together, leading to the 
		formation of Fenian cadres in both the Union and Confederate armies. 
		They met to break the monotony of camp, wrote Fenian soldier Thomas 
		Galwey, of the 8th OVI, and to plan for the day they could use their 
		military experience to help Ireland defeat England. As the war drew to a 
		close James Stephens came to America and promised that in 1865 he would 
		lead a rebellion in Ireland. The Fenian leadership began to collect 
		funds to pull it off. The campaign was called “the final call” and as 
		subscriptions to the Fenians grew, serious money began to flow into 
		Fenian coffers.</font></p>
		<p align="justify"><br>
		<font size="6">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I</font><font size="5">n September of 
		1865 before Irish-America could set sail and rescue Ireland, Britain 
		struck and arrested all the IRB leaders including, in November, James 
		Stephens. Stephens escaped from jail immediately, but the arrests 
		insured the insurrection would not succeed. The IRB was left a shambles. 
		Under leadership of Irish-American Civil War veterans, the IRB/Fenians 
		did manage to initiate scattered skirmishes with the Royal Irish 
		Constabulary but in general the IRB was impotent to welcome any 
		crusading Irish-Americans. The Fenian Brotherhood in America was 
		unprepared for the arrests and, in reality, no thought-through plan of 
		action existed as to how the FB was going to supply their brothers in 
		arms. The FB purchased a ship, the <i>Jacmel Packet,</i> christened her 
		&quot;<i>Erin's Hope</i>&quot; and sailed for Ireland with arms and men aboard. <i>
		Erin's Hope</i> arrived with too little, too late, her landing party 
		arrested coming ashore. <i>Erin's Hope</i> returned to America leaving 
		Irish nationalists without support. With the decimation of the Irish 
		connection, the Fenians began to feud amongst themselves with two main 
		factions emerging. Those under John O’Mahony (O’Mahony Wing) wanted to 
		wait while Ireland reorganized and got ready for another attempt; while 
		followers of Fenian Senate leader, W. R. Roberts (Senate Wing) wanted to 
		attack Canada and perhaps pull the United States into a war with the 
		British. John O’Mahony in a futile bid to head off the takeover of the 
		Fenian coffers by the Senate Wing, decided to attack Campobello Island 
		in Canada near Eastport, Maine. The history of what happened at this 
		point is told on this website under the title “Here Comes That Damn Green Flag 
		Again!”</font></p>

		<p align="justify"><br>
		<font size="6">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; T</font><font size="5">he aftermath of 
		the 3rd attack on Canada in 1870, led by John O’Neill over the 
		objections of the Senate Wing left the Fenians in total disarray and the Fenian factions continued to assault 
		each other in the press, much to the amusement of&nbsp; American 
		journalism. 
		One man began an organization which would change Irish-American 
		nationalism and provide a real foundation for Irish independence which 
		was acheived fifty 
		years later. </font></p>
		<p align="justify"><font size="5">Early in 1867, a civil engineer, Jerome Collins, operating 
		on his own and, although he was not a member of the IRB, planned a rescue prisoner 
		of IRB prisoners held in Pentonville prison in London. Before Collins 
		could pull it off British authorities discovered the plot as a result 
		of the loose tongue of a member of Collin's group. Collins fled to New York where he 
		joined the Fenian Brotherhood. Collins wanted to bring the two Wings together 
		for anti-British actions for which purpose he founded a secretive organization called 
		the Napper Tandy Club. The group was designed to enlist both Wings of 
		the FB together to plan “operations” against the British. Gradually 
		other branches formed and in the 1870s these loosely attached clubs 
		began to be known collectively as the Clan Na Gael Association.</font></p>
		<p align="justify"><br>
		<font size="5">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </font><font size="6">T</font><font size="5">he 
		Clan-na-Gael at its inception was a more middle to upper class 
		composition in its 
		constituency than the FB had been. Both W. R. Roberts and John O'Mahony joined Collins’ new 
		club at the beginning. As the Clan-na-Gael grew, the membership 
		included upper and middle class Protestants such as Dr. William Carroll, a 
		Philadelphia physician and 
		George Pepper, a Protestant minister, as well as other respected men in the community. 
		The Clan-na-Gael could boast of Irish Americans who had risen to 
		prominence in American political life like Judges James W. Fitzgerald of 
		Cincinnati,&nbsp; and James Fitzgerald and John Goff of New York. The Clan-na-Gael also could count on elected congressmen and 
		senators, men well known outside the Irish-American community. The 
		Clan-na-Gael allowed members into its ranks whether or not they belonged 
		to other nationalist groups: both FB Wings, the Ancient Order of 
		Hibernians and other clubs not affiliated to the Fenian movement. 
		</font></p>
		<p align="justify"><font size="5">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the Fall of 1870, responding to a letter from the grand &quot;Old Man&quot; of Fenianism, 
		James Gibbons, who had invited all Irish nationalist groups to Cincinnati, 
		the Senate Wing faction, along with a few random circles of the O'Mahony 
		Wing and various clubs with other affiliations assembled at a convention 
		designed to bring unity to Irish nationalism. This convention (I 
		believe from my research) indicates collusion, if not spoken, then, 
		unspoken, between some Senate Wing moderates who were also members of 
		the Clan-na-Gael, and the Clan-na-Gael organization itself. </font></p>
		<p align="justify"><font size="5">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The 
		Clan-na-Gael constitution forbade divulging any member’s name to the 
		public. That rule restricted the Clan-na-Gael Association from sending delegates to 
		the Cincinnati convention. However there was another option, the 
		Clan-na-Gael when it wished to hold picnics, dances, or open club 
		meetings would often set up a front club outside the actual 
		organizational structure&nbsp; which allowed the names of the members of 
		the front club to be publicized. Having such a front also facilitated recruitment into the Clan. I postulate 
		that the &quot;Irish National Brotherhood&quot; a club constituted ad hoc just 
		before the Cincinnati convention in St Louis was a front organization of the 
		Clan-na-Gael. The INB appeared for the convention then, after the 
		convention adjourned, disappeared from public view . The St Louis INB 
		under Daniel O'Madigan had known Clan members on its executive 
		council. It is significant to note that this newly formed club under O’Madigan was allowed a seat on the proposed unity council at the 
		convention. John O'Neill railed against the Clan-na-Gael in an 
		address from jail in Windsor, Vermont where he was incarcerated after his abortive 
		1870 attack on Canada, adds further weight to the theory that the 
		Clan-na-Gael took part in the Convention. </font><br>
&nbsp;</p>
		<p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <font size="5">The name chosen for 
		the unity organization that was formed during the Cincinnati convention 
		was the 
		“United Irishmen” hearkening back to the United Irishmen Rebellion of 
		1798. In the <i>Irish-American</i>, a Senate Wing New York newspaper, 
		there is significant newspaper space donated to the formation and 
		constitution of the United Irishmen. Unfortunately as far as the 
		objective of unity the United Irishmen failed to gain traction. The 
		position of John Savage (president of the O'Mahony FB Wing) and General 
		John O'Neill (president of his own breakaway group) vis-à-vis the United 
		Irishmen is aptly portrayed in the O'Neill Windsor, Vermont jail speech. 
		</font></p>
		<p align="justify"><font size="5">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In 1871 the arrival of the &quot;Exiles&quot; a group of IRB prisoners recently 
		released from English prisons including John Devoy and Jeremiah 
		O’Donovan Rossa, gave the floundering United Irishmen an exit. The 
		United Irishmen formally turned their entire organization over to&nbsp; 
		the Exiles with the hope that these men would be a catalyst for unity. 
		Men from the 
		Clan-na-Gael held the top posts in the United Irishmen 
		(W.J. Nicholson, John W. Goff, Timothy Hanly, Thomas Sheedy, etc.). The 
		Exiles renamed the organization “The Irish Confederation.” One might 
		suppose that the Irish Confederation was formally connected to the 
		Clan-na-Gael with the inclusion of the Irish National Brotherhood club into the 
		United Irishmen at the Cincinnati convention; but that this was not the 
		case is shown in documents from NLI: in the minutes of a meeting of the 
		Irish Confederation, the Exiles are shown planning to make an offer to 
		the Clan-na-Gael to join the Irish Confederation in a plan to begin 
		sending money to the IRB. The Irish National Brotherhood evaporated itself when the United Irishmen failed to unify Irish 
		Nationalism. </font></p>
		<p align="justify"><font size="6">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; W</font><font size="5">hen 
		the Irish Confederation didn't do any better than its predecessors, 
		the Exiles threw up their hands and began to infiltrate the existing Irish-American 
		nationalist societies from within (either consciously or subconsciously – for my 
		part it is hard to imagine such political worthies as O’Kelly, McClure, Devoy, Bourke, Luby, O’Leary, Rossa etc. not having an actual strategy, 
		as opposed to a scenario that they just randomly joined these various organizations). Rossa joined the 
		O'Mahony (now called &quot;Savage&quot;) Wing and, in 1877, was elected president 
		of the organization. The Savage Wing was from the beginning the real 
		rock in the road to unity -- the Exiles Thomas Clarke Luby and James J. 
		O'Kelly, also joined the Savage Wing . The Senate was already well 
		represented in the Clan-na-Gael, and, according to Devoy, most of the Exiles also joined the 
		Clan-na-Gael. As the Irish Confederation 
		disintegrated, it is safe to assume the affiliated clubs either had 
		their members sworn into the Clan-na-Gael, joined the Savage Wing, 
		became independent clubs, or disbanded. By 1877 the Exiles, moving up 
		through the ranks, were represented in hierarchical positions in the Fenian factions as 
		well as in the Clan-na-Gael. I 
		suspect that James W. Fitzgerald (Cincinnati Judge and Senate Wing member) and I know 
		that John Goff, Tim Hanly and W. J. Nicholson were Clan-na-Gael 
		members, and maybe even “Old Man” James Gibbons of Philadelphia 
		(although Gibbons by 1870 was sixty-five and may have remained aloof 
		from all the turmoil). The Clan-na-Gael engineered a successful 
		rescue of the IRB military prisoners from Australia aboard the whaling 
		vessel <i>Catalpa</i> and furnished proof&nbsp; that the Clan-na-Gael was capable of executing a filibuster 
		against the British without botching it up. 
		Membership 
		increased significantly as other factions of Irish nationalism 
		in America drifted towards irrelevance. </font>
		<font size="6">T</font><font size="5">he Clan-na-Gael rose in power but 
		generally remained in the background out of the newspapers except for 
		annual picnics and grand balls organized as fund-raisers. </font><br>
&nbsp;</p>
		<p align="justify"><font size="5">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In 1876, a 
		money-collecting scheme named the “Skirmishing Fund” was organized to 
		support 
		terrorist actions under the auspices of John Ford's Irish nationalist newspaper, the <i>Irish World</i>. Fund activity was published each week 
		in the <i>Irish World</i> and the money was managed by O’Donovan Rossa 
		and a council of well known Irishmen. The fund later was taken 
		from Rossa by the Clan-na-Gael who threatened to disclose his sloppy 
		bookkeeping. When Rossa let the fund go to the Clan-na-Gael there were a lot of non-Clan-na-Gael subscribers to the 
		fund who were really ticked off. The vituperation over the skirmishing 
		fund went on and on in Irish-American newspapers until 1880 when Rossa tried to 
		start up a new 
		organization with an old name, the &quot;United Irishmen.&quot; An unwanted 
		result of Rossa’s effort was that most of the skirmishing fund 
		subscribers who attended the convention focused the convention single-mindedly on 
		&quot;who has all the Skirmishing money?&quot; Rossa was disgusted and 
		his effort to form a new 
		organization quickly came to naught — as a result of this 
		escapade Rossa was booted out of the Clan-na-Gael. <br>
&nbsp;</font></p>
		<p align="justify"><font size="6">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I</font><font size="5">n</font><font size="6"> </font>
		<font size="5">1879, Devoy realized that the Irish population did not 
		fully support radical nationalism and he convinced the Clan-na-Gael to 
		launch the &quot;New Departure,&quot; a scheme whereby the 
		Clan-na-Gael and the IRB (reluctantly) agreed to assist the Irish Land League. 
		Cooperation between the Land League and the IRB disintegrated 
		when the Land Leaguers were put in jail and the IRB, never in favor of 
		political action over revolution, opted out of 
		supporting what they termed non-republican goals. Devoy and Dr. Carroll had presided 
		over 6 
		years of relative inaction by the Clan-na-Gael against British 
		interests. Seen as too moderate by many, Devoy and Carroll lost 
		their grip on the the Clan-na-Gael Executive Body&nbsp; the council that 
		was charged with accomplishing the agenda of the Clan-na-Gael. 
		Members within the Clan-na-Gael began demanding some “real 
		action” against the British. A more radical element now took control of 
		the Clan-na-Gael led by three men (who became known as “The 
		Triangle”) Alexander Sullivan of Chicago, Michael Boland of Louisville, 
		and, a weak sister, Denis Feeley of Chicago.&nbsp; During the 1882 Chicago United Brotherhood convention (the 
		Clan-na-Gael in internal correspondence called itself the United 
		Brotherhood) the convention, packed delegates in favor of Chicago's 
		Alexander Sullivan, shoved Devoy and Dr. Carroll to the side and began 
		an era of Clan-na-Gael terrorist activity. </font></p>
		<p align="justify"><font size="5">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </font><font size="6">T</font><font size="5">he 
		&quot;Triangle&quot;&nbsp; took over the Revolutionary Directory and began to use 
		directory funds for their own ends, not informing 
		the IRB Supreme Council what they were doing. Sullivan and Boland 
		also hid Clan-na-Gael internal operations from view of rank and file members. The Clan hierarchy, principally under Michael Boland, began a dynamiting campaign against British targets in 
		England. At this point Alexander Sullivan made a great error in 
		judgment and brought British spy Henri Le Caron into the 
		Clan-na-Gael -- no hint exists that Alexander Sullivan was in contact with British authorities but there is strong evidence that the 
		Executive Body Chairman, Michael Boland, was on the British payroll. Rossa, at this same time, 
		apparently on his own hook and outside the Clan, contributed to the 
		chaos and began sending bombers 
		of his own to attack targets in England using funds from his 
		subscription journal, <i>The United Irishman</i>. </font></p>
		<p align="justify"><font size="5">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Meanwhile, Devoy, never in 
		agreement with the dynamite operations, joined Dr. Patrick 
		Henry Cronin, an opponent of Sullivan in local Chicago politics, and 
		together they waged a campaign 
		expose the operations of Sullivan and Boland. Sullivan wasn't actually a Clan 
		Executive member at the time, and it is probable that Cronin was trying 
		to destroy Sullivan for his own political ends in Chicago. Devoy was 
		happy to join Cronin because it fit with Devoy's desire to refocus the 
		Clan-na-Gael on political objectives in Ireland and effect a 
		reunification with the IRB. In 1889 a public-relations 
		disaster occurred that nearly destroyed the Clan-na-Gael’s viability as an 
		instrument for Irish Independence. Alexander Sullivan's loyalists from 
		Chicago's Clan-na-Gael Camp 20 murdered Dr. Cronin and stuffed his 
		naked body into a drainage flume. The trial of the assassination squad 
		created a media circus that was followed closely by all the major newspapers across the 
		country. Investigations by the court and newspaper reporter exposés 
		allowed light to be shed on the inner workings of the 
		Clan as investigators probed Clan Camps and members in major cities across the U.S..</font></p>
		<p align="justify"><font size="5">It took ten years to wash away the 
		recriminations and public name calling between the various factions of 
		the Clan-na-Gael. Finally, in 1900, a reunification of sorts took place 
		when John Devoy, with the help of Luke Dillon and others, patched up the 
		break. Clan-na-Gael history from 1880 forward can be found covered in 
		Owen McGee's&nbsp; recently published book, The <u>Irish Revolutionary 
		Brotherhood</u>. </font></p>
