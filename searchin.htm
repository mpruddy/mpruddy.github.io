</strong><font color="#FF0000"><strong>Sources other than NARA:</strong></font><strong><br>
The 1890 census had a separate schedule of Union veterans still
living. This is just about the only part of the 1890 census still
extant, as the rest burned in a NARA fire in 1922.</strong></p>

<p><strong>Most Union states published lists of the soldiers and
many unit histories were written which contain unit rosters.
Civil War Bookstores and Publishers have reprinted many of these.</strong></p>

<p><font color="#FF0000" size="5"><strong>Confederate:</strong></font><font
color="#FF0000"><strong> Sources other than NARA:</strong></font><strong><br>
There is a multi-volume set of books which is an index of all
Confederate Veterans. This is alphabetical, not by state. Most
big genealogy libraries have a set. The Nat. Genealogical Society
library in Arlington, VA has one, for example.<br>
Also, a lot of state lists were published as separate books or in
unit histories. An example is Tennesseans In The War.<br>
Each state of the former CSA maintains military service records
in its archives. In addition, the states also maintain
Confederate pension records. Pensions were means-tested, so not
every veteran received one. Furthermore, the pension legislation
didn't get passed in most states until AFTER Reconstruction, some
as late as 1899, etc., so if the veteran died before this and did
not leave a widow, they would also not have received a<br>
pension.<br>
Information is more difficult to obtain for militia units.
Militia units later in the War were basically those ineligible
for regular military service: older men, boys. Units that were
only called up a few days would not generally be eligible for
pensions (depending upon the state). For example: the Georgia
militia was called up and asked to report. They organized
themselves into regiments, companies, etc., and did their own
muster rolls. The local militia captains often registered these
muster rolls with their local courthouse but often did not.</strong></p>

<strong>Confederate Records: (Our thanks to the author, Jeff
Weaver, an author of Civil War Military books)</strong></p>

<p><strong>Confederate pensions for Virginia: Thought I would
scribble a few lines which might be of help for Virginia Pension
searches. I would imagine that other states had similar
requirements, but I am not certain of this. The legislature
authorized three pension acts, 1888, 1900, and 1902. </strong></p>

<ul>
    <li><strong>The first, 1888 granted pensions to veterans who
        were severely disabled in service, such as loosing a
        limb, head wounds, etc., or to indigent widows who had
        lost their husbands in the war and had not remarried. </strong></li>
    <li><strong>The Act of 1900 extended pensions to those who
        had contracted some long term medical problem in service,
        suffered wounds less serious than those covered in the
        1888 act, and to widows of these veterans.</strong> </li>
    <li><strong>The Act of 1902 further extended pensions to just
        about anyone who had served in the war. <br>
        </strong></li>
</ul>

<p><strong><br>
With all of this said, there were some caveats to obtaining a
pension. First there were property requirements. Anyone who
applied for a pension could not have more than $1000 in real
property, nor have an income from any source in excess of $300
per year. Additionally, if a veteran had a government job, such
as mail carrier, deputy sheriff, etc., they were ineligible for a
pension as long as they held the government job. A veteran, or
his widow, was also ineligible for a pension if they resided with
a child able to care and provide for them.<br>
<br>
When a veteran or his widow completed his or her application, it
was submitted to a local pension board, composed of from three to
five local veterans. The board met quarterly or semi-annually,
depending upon the volume of work to be done. (These boards were
discontinued in 1925). This board reviewed the application and
either approved or disapproved it. If a veteran met the property
limits, a pension was usually approved, but not always. Some were
rejected for insufficient evidence of service, and were set aside
for further investigation. Others were rejected out of hand
because the applicant was a &quot;deserter.&quot; Occasionally a
pension was approved that should not have been (usually because
of the desertion question), it was recalled and revoked. The
pension board also set the amount of the pension. When it was
approved at the local level it was forwarded to the auditor of
Public Accounts in Richmond for disbursement.<br>
<br>
Virginia only granted pensions to veterans or their widows who
lived within their borders. If an approved pensioner moved to
another state, his pension was discontinued. Virginia granted
pensions to soldiers from other states who lived in Virginia at
the time of application for a pension, but did not grant pensions
to Virginians who moved to other states or who lived in West
Virginia..<br>
<br>
The auditor of public accounts compiled annual lists of
pensioners. These lists were published and are available for
review at the Library of Virginia in Richmond.&nbsp; </strong></p>

While the majority of names appear to be those of men, women were
able to prosecute their own claims and many claims were brought
in behalf of an estate. Copies of the files for allowed claims
are available from NARA. It is possible obtain copies of
disallowed claims from NARA on microfiche as well. These claims
may include testimony of neighbors, relatives, and slaves,
supporting the claimant's assertion that he/she is due funds to
repay for property taken from a loyal union person during the
late Unpleasantness. It does indeed make for interesting reading.</strong></font></p>
