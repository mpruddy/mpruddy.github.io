<blockquote>
	<p class="MsoNormal" align="center" style="text-align: justify">
	<font size="3">Patrick J. Meehan (born in Limerick in 1831) was a leader in 
	the Fenian organization and, when, partially attributable to Meehan's 
	carelessness, British arrests of the IRB leaders in September of 1865 
	brought about a split the organization, Meehan became a leader of the Senate 
	Wing opposition to John O'Mahony. The GA obituary is written from the 
	viewpoint of the Clan na Gael of 1906 which had [and still has] its own ax 
	to grind in the interpretation of Fenianism, but, aside from what may be GA 
	editor John Devoy's opinions, the facts are accurate as far as Meehan's 
	life. The assassination attempt on Meehan by James Keenan referred to in the 
	obituary occurred when Keenan, a fellow who had been chosen by General John 
	O'Neill for the post of Secretary of Civilian Affairs in the Fenian 
	organization, was rejected by the Fenian Senate Council. Meehan secured the 
	dismissal of Keenan, characterizing Keenan as an &quot;obnoxious partisan&quot; 
	[William DÁrcy p. 342] of O'Neill. Keenan, who was listening to the debate 
	from another room, followed Meehan outside and shot him. <br>
	The year 1870 saw the beginning of the total disintegration of the Fenians. 
	O'Neill, who was president of the Senate Wing split from the organization in 
	order to lead the 1870 Canadian attack which was not supported by the Senate 
	or the Savage Wings. The attack was a dismal failure. O'Neill ended up with 
	his few supporters in the Savage Wing (O'Mahony's group). The Senate, after 
	O'Neill's antics, attempted to transform itself into a unified Irish 
	nationalist organization. The Savage Wing was not interested in joining. A 
	recruiting campaign by the fledgling Clan na Gael more or less finished off 
	the Senate Wing which went from calling itself &quot;The United Irishmen&quot; to &quot;The 
	Irish Confederation&quot; and finally disbanded into oblivion. The Savage Wing 
	hung on for years but The Clan na Gael from 1874 on was in the driver's seat 
	of Irish American Nationalism. </font></p>

<blockquote>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: .5in"><b>
	<font size="4">Mr. Patrick 
J. Meehan, editor of the <i>Irish-American</i>, died at his residence in Jersey 
City on Friday, April 20, of bronchitis, in his seventy-fourth year. Mr. Meehan 
was for many years a prominent figure in Irish national politics, and his paper 
was at one time the chief organ of Irish opinion in the United States.</font></b></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: .5in"><b>
	<font size="4">Born in 
Limerick, in 1832, he came to this country in early manhood, and was connected 
with the <i>Irish-American</i>, most of the time as editor, for fifty-four 
years. When the Civil War broke out he threw the influence of the paper 
decisively on the side of the Union and took an active part in organizing the 
Irish regiments which went to the front from New York. He was a Democrat in 
politics, but never held a p0ulic office and never sought one.</font></b></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: .5in"><b>
	<font size="4">Aside from 
the editorship of the Irish-American, Meehan was best known to Irishmen in 
connection with the Fenian movement, although many have erroneous views as to 
the part he played in it. He was the leading spirit on one side of a great 
split, which occurred at the crisis of the movement, and led to acrimonious 
discussions, prolonged over many years, and he was therefore subjected by his 
opponents to more bitter criticism than any other leader on either side. So as 
these criticisms refer to his honesty or the sincerity of his patriotism, they 
were wholly without foundation, and time has done him full justice. As to the 
wisdom of his course, it may be impugned without any reflection on his character 
or motives.</font></b></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" align="center" style="text-align: center; text-indent: .5in">
	<b><font size="4">DIFFERED WITH O’MAHONY</font></b></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: .5in"><b>
	<font size="4">He did not 
come into the Fenian movement at its inception, bu t almost from the moment he 
entered it he found himself more or less in disagreement with John O’Mahony, the 
founder and head of the movement. O’Mahony had a fine intellect and a better 
historical knowledge of Ireland than any man of his day, as it is clearly shown 
by his annotations to his translation from the Irish of Keating’s History of 
Ireland. He had also, perhaps, a clearer conception than any Irishman of his day 
of the theoretical plans by which the Irish people could be organized for the 
overthrow of British domination. But O’Mahony was temperamentally a dreamer and 
most unpractical in the ways of the world. Meehan had a very thorough knowledge 
of Ireland and had a clear, business head, but he lacked O’Mahony’s breadth of 
view, so that each looked at Irish affairs from different standpoints. Different 
views of policy were sure to come, and that came in the shape of a split which 
wrecked the movement after it had grown to enormous proportions, Meehan’s side 
insisting on an invasion of Canada, while O’Mahony’s partisans stood by the old 
policy of aiding the people of Ireland to strike for liberty on Irish soil. This 
was the real cause of the failure of the movement in Ireland and is the real 
lesson left by Fenianism.</font></b></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: .5in"><b>
	<font size="4">Mr. Meehan 
and his friends were not satisfied with the Home Organization, and were 
constantly urging O’Mahony to demand specific information, changes of plan and 
compromise with such public men as George Henry Moore, John Martin, P. J. Smyth, 
The O’Donoghue and Alexander M. Sullivan, of the Dublin <i>Nation</i>, some of 
whom were friendly to the principle of the movement, but others opposed to it 
and bitterly hostile to its leaders. This provoked resentment in Ireland and led 
to friction between the Home Organization and the leaders in America. Almost an 
open rupture was created by the presentation of a sort of ultimatum by the 
American organization thirty-two pages long, which was rejected by a meeting 
fully representative of the men at home and presided over by Charles J. Kickham.</font></b></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" align="center" style="text-align: center; text-indent: .5in">
	<b><font size="4">EXONERATED FROM GUILT</font></b></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: .5in"><b>
	<font size="4">In 1865 P. 
J. Meehan and P. W. Dunne (father of the present Mayor of Chicago) were sent to 
Ireland as envoys, and Mr. Meehan unfortunately lost on the platform of the 
railroad station at Kingstown a document which he had pinned to the top of his 
drawers. It was picked up by a girl employed in the telegraph office and given 
to the manager, who, being a loyalist, gave it to the police. The document was 
intrinsically of no importance, but it supplied to the Government the connecting 
link between the Home Organization and the one in America. Coupled with a letter 
entrusted for delivery in Tipperary to Pierce Nagle, a British spy who had 
secured employment in the office of the Dublin Irish People, and which he gave 
up to the castle, it made the evidence on which the Government determined to act 
with vigor. The police swooped down on the office of the paper on September 15, 
1865, seized its plant and every scrap of paper found in the office and arrested 
a number of the leaders. But even then, with the document lost by Meehan, the 
letter supplied by Nagle and the latter’s oral evidence, the Government would 
have been unable to convict any of the prisoners of any more serious offence 
that sedition, involving not more than a year or two of imprisonment, but for 
the documents found in the houses of the prisoners themselves and an important 
document foolishly brought from American by a returning Fenian and found on his 
person when arrested in Queenstown. These are the facts about these documents, 
and there was never any justification for any charge of treachery or dishonesty 
in connection with their loss, although there was undoubtedly negligence.</font></b></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" align="center" style="text-align: center; text-indent: .5in">
	<b><font size="4">THE DISASTROUS SPLIT</font></b></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: .5in"><b>
	<font size="4">It may be 
well to add here that a thorough investigation of all the circumstances by the 
organization resulted in clearing Mr. Meehan of all guilt in the matter. Some 
impetuous men in Dublin wanted him killed, but Stephens sternly repressed them, 
and his verdict as to Mr. Meehan’s action was the verdict of the organization 
and settled the question for good. Mr. Meehan returned to America, the 
disastrous split broke out at the close of the same year, and the incident was 
used by those who differed with him as an argument against the side he took. 
Later Mr. Meehan was shot by a medical student with whom he had personal 
differences, and the cry was raised that the act was the result of the Kingstown 
incident, but it had no connection whatever with it, the man who fired the shot 
being on Mr. Meehan’s own side. He survived the wound, but carried the bullet in 
his body to the day of his death. He acted most generously to his assailant, and 
joined in a movement to secure his release from prison which after some years 
succeeded.</font></b></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: .5in"><b>
	<font size="4">During the 
years that have elapsed since Fenianism was reorganized under another form, Mr. 
Meehan’s activities have been mainly connected with the conduct of the <i>Irish-American</i>. A widow and eight children survive him. He celebrated his 
golden wedding two years ago, and, as a mark of the esteem which his services to 
the Church were held, Bishop O’Connor, of Newark, sent him permission to have 
the jubilee mass said in his own residence.</font></b></p>
