        January 8</strong><sup><strong>th</strong></sup><strong>
        1863<br>
        </strong><p><strong>Dear Father, Mother, and Amelia</strong></p>
        <p><strong>I am not dead, wounded, or sick, but, on the
        contrary, never felt better in my life. Have since I left
        Nashville. I can say that I have had an active part in as
        hard a battle as has been fought during the war.</strong></p>
        <p><strong>A general move of the army was made on the 26</strong><sup><strong>th</strong></sup><strong>
        Ult. The fighting commenced about 10 miles from Nashville
        the same day and lasted nine days. When the rebels were
        driven from Murfreesboro. The 4</strong><sup><strong>th</strong></sup><strong>
        Michigan has won at least a name and place. On Saturday
        27</strong><sup><strong>th</strong></sup><strong> four
        companies under Captain Mix were sent out and came upon a
        strong body of rebel cavalry. There was about 150 of us
        we charged upon 200 of them, drove them about 2 miles
        shot 5 of their men, a no. of horses and took 8
        prisoners. One of our corporals was wounded in the side. </strong></p>
        <p><strong>January 9</strong><sup><strong>th</strong></sup></p>
        <p><strong>We have been busy today arranging our tent. We
        have got a sesesh stove, Table and Bunk, taken from one
        of their camps.</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Our Company was engaged in Wednesday&#146;s
        fight. We made two charges upon rebel cavalry. Capt
        Mix[Frank W Mix] had a splendid horse shot from under
        him, our quartermaster Sgt was wounded. I have had 3 or 4
        narrow escapes, have been where the cannon ball and
        shells were flying close around me and I must be lucky. I
        did not think of getting killed at all but I expected to
        be wounded. We entered Murfreesboro on Monday. The rebs
        left Saturday night. Out right was driven back on
        Wednesday with great slaughter on both sides. I passed
        over the field Monday. The rebels had carried nearly all
        of their dead, ours were lying in rows as they had been
        carried to bury. Horses dead and guns and artillery
        filled the ground. I can&#146;t tell you anything of the
        sight.</strong></p>
        <p><strong>The rebels captured and burnt a part of our
        train and among the rest our company wagon were stolen
        excepting what I had on. The likenesses and the books are
        gone. The captains and lieutenants clothes were all gone.
        Such are the fortunes of war. John Gilbert was not with
        us thru the fighting was not very tough and had a
        pactious? horse he staid with the train. Charley
        Smith[Charles H Smith] is without doubt dead, he died
        with the black jaundice as we were informed. Herman
        Lounsbury[Herman H Lounsbury] is very sick. I am afraid
        he will have a hard time of it if he ever gets well.
        Charley Starkweather[Charles A Starkweather] is isolated
        with a lame back. Alf Shepard and Norman Smith are well.
        We shall be very busy for a week now making out our
        payrolls &#150; have a good deal of writing. L J
        Southworth[Lorenzo T Southworth] is writing home he is
        well. I am liking soldiering as well as ever, if only I
        keep well and I never felt better-- </strong></p>

        Give my love to all, and write soon, the news I have not
        heard from you since I left Nashville.<br>
        I sent a sesesh envelope and some cottin seed, plant them
        they will grow.<br>

        <td width="100%"><strong>In this letter Henry Albert
        Potter recounts the charge of the 7th PA and a Union
        debacle south of Franklin. I am using MINTY AND THE
        CAVALRY(pub. 1886), by Joseph Vale, Captain 7th PA
        Cavalry. I condense the story: On March 4, 1863 Minty
        ordered the charge of the 7th Pennsylvania, using sabres
        as the principle weapon, which resulted in capture of
        Unionville, TN. Afterwards General Rosecrans
        &quot;directed that it [7th PA Cav] be known henceforth,
        in the department, as the sabre regiment of the Army of
        the Cumberland.&quot; On March 5, 1863 the Union attacked
        General Nathan Bedford Forrest at Spring Hill with
        &quot;the 85th Indiana Inf, the 19th Michigan Inf, the
        22nd Wisconsin inf, the 124th Ohio Inf, the 9th
        Pennsylvania Cav, and 4 pieces of artillery.&quot; The
        rebel force at Spring Hill included &quot;Van Dorn and
        Price's Cavalry to a total of twelve thousand&quot; men.
        [when you read regimental histories you must be careful
        of estimates of enemy strength] The information of the
        disaster and increased activity of Rebel Cavalry resulted
        in General Sheridan directing Minty to be sent as
        reenforcement toward Franklin on March 6th, 1863.</strong></td>

        Sunday Mar 8</strong><sup><strong>th</strong></sup><strong>
        1863</strong><p><strong>Dear Father</strong></p>
        <p><strong>I have been thinking of home today. Of the
        pleasure we could all have if I were there with you all a
        short time. It is a warm balmy spring day. The birds are
        singing. The trees are budding and Nature is working
        quiet and harmonius amid the bustle of the camp. We had a
        heavy thunder shower last night. But I slept soundly in
        my little storm tent as dry as a pig. I still keep tough
        and hearty. I stand camp life and its hardships much
        better than I thought I would when I enlisted. I believe
        I feel better than if at home teaching. If I live to come
        home again you will see me a tough man. This the fifth
        day out. We started from Murfreesboro last Wednesday
        morning with a brigade of infantry. We are in the 1</strong><sup><strong>st</strong></sup><strong>
        Cavalry Brigade under Col Minty[Robert H G Minty] of this
        regiment but acting brigadier. He will get a star before
        long, I believe, every body likes him also and he is a
        rising man. Lt Col Dickinson[William H Dickenson] has resigned[disability]. Major Park[Josiah B Park] is now Lt
        Col. He has not been with us much, is acting inspector of
        cavalry, I think don&#146;t know when he will be with us,
        if ever. Major Gray[Horace Gray] and Huston[Joseph P
        Huston] are home recruiting. Have not seen any of their
        recruits yet. They are not worth anything to us, nor
        never would be and among the many promotions who else do
        you suppose has been hit &#150; myself, as true as
        preaching. I was promoted to 2</strong><sup><strong>nd</strong></sup><strong>
        Lieut. The 27</strong><sup><strong>th</strong></sup><strong>
        Feb&#146;y and transferred to E Company under Capt
        Tolton[Joseph B Tolton]. He is a good military man, well
        drilled, but is not very healthy. I hav been in command
        of the Comp. ever since have been in it. And expect to be
        half of the time. J W Mann[Joshua W Mann] is 1</strong><sup><strong>st</strong></sup><strong>
        Lt but is detached and in command of the brigade provost
        guard. He will never be back in the Company, probably, I
        hope not at least. I do not have near as much to do now
        as I did when Orderly. My pay is $129 per month, out of
        that pay $16 per month for forage for horse. Have to hire
        a darkey and find myself in everything. Still I think I
        can save considerable. I have bought a coat sack for $15
        and vest $6. My straps I got from my predecessor. They
        are nice ones. We have been paid up to the 31</strong><sup><strong>st</strong></sup><strong>
        of October. I rec&#146;d $36.25 cnts. Uncle Sam owes me
        about $75 yet as an enlisted man. I have to get may
        discharge papers made out and then be mustered as a
        com&#146;s&#146;d officer. I have no need to complain but
        2 or 3 enlisted men in the reg&#146;t have done as well
        as I. There are 5 Orderlies that have been such since the
        reg&#146;t was formed and are likely to stay so. I am the
        2</strong><sup><strong>nd</strong></sup><strong> Orderly
        promoted over Co. &#145;E&#146;s orderly and been
        assigned over him. He is a clever fellow but not very
        competent. I must hse him well. I shall still try to do
        my duty. As long as I do so, I still have friends to help
        me to anything. I have not got me a very good horse
        yet.(never had the Bigdon? horse, major Mix owns him.)
        But shall get one as soon as possible. I can take and
        receipt for any horse we come across thro the country and
        will improve the chance. I want to get a good rig
        throughout to bring home with me. I am glad you have got
        another mare. You will have a good way to get around and
        go visiting. I don&#146;t want you to kill yourself
        fretting or working, but live as easy as you can. Hiram
        K[Hiram J Knowles] wants me to buy his farm and I
        don&#146;t know but what it would be a good plan,
        wouldn&#146;t it? Hiram is not tough. I am sorry &#150;
        poor John[John Gilbert]. I feel lonesome without him. He
        stood a good chance to be Orderly in Co B if he had not
        broken his leg. Maybe he can get his discharge. I advised
        him to, if he could. I think he can. Let Mr. Gilbert read
        this. I read his letter to John. I have written so much
        about myself you will think I am getting vain. But I
        wanted to let you know what my prospects are and have
        been. Lorenzo[Lorenzo T Southworth] is now QM
        Serg&#146;t. He heas done as well as anybody could and he
        deserves it. Charley S[Charley A Starkweather] is back
        with the Co. He is well again. Lewis Coon is dead. He is
        from [Duplain], I believe. Alf Shepard has been sick as
        long time. He will be discharged, he tells me. Norm Smith
        is very sick. If he lives he will do well. His is a good
        boy. I like Norman and hope he will get well&#151;</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Oh! how I would like some Maple Sugar. I you
        think there is any chance to get it to me you may send a
        little box and anything else you think I would like. Send
        to Murfreesboro and write before you send. You will have
        to send by express, if at all. </strong></p>
        <p><strong>Now I must tell you about our scout. The first
        day out we surprised about 600 graybacks, made a charge
        on them and captured about 50 of them. A capt and 2
        lieuts. The 7</strong><sup><strong>th</strong></sup><strong>
        Penn was ahead with their sabres They won&#146;t stand
        the sabres. They all know the 7</strong><sup><strong>th</strong></sup><strong>
        . They call them the fighting 7</strong><sup><strong>th</strong></sup><strong>
        and hate them accordingly. We go out in such numbers that
        unless there is a large force of them they won&#146;t
        stand. I have not had a chance to fire my pistol since
        the big battle. Our Brigade has captured about 400 since
        then. I should judge. Now I must tell you some bad news.
        We had 1500 men captured last Friday. Infantry, Col
        Gilbert of the 19</strong><sup><strong>th</strong></sup><strong>
        Mich was com&#146;d&#146;g the brigade. He is a new
        officer and too fast. He was out Thursday and attacked
        and drove the rebs. The next day flushed with victory,
        attacked them. They run as usual. He followed them on and
        on until from each side and behind a swarm of the enemy
        came out and they were cut off. Fighting was useless and
        they were captured, the most of them. The Col got away, I
        believe. A smart man is needed to lead men successfully.
        Van Dorn is encamped 5 miles from here and Wheeler&#146;s
        Cavalry. They are reported 15,000 strong and are saucy.
        There will be another big battle before long, I think.
        30,000 men are here, so said. But I doubt it we will
        probably move in the morning and maybe will have a
        battle, can&#146;t tell. I don&#146;t know how this
        letter will get thru! Write. Give my love to all my
        friends. To Mr Gilbert especially and Mrs Longham.</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Direct to Co &quot;E&quot; instead of
        &quot;B&quot;. Good bye. I never forget Home sweet Home</strong></p>

        1863</strong><p><strong>Dear Father</strong></p>
        <p><strong>I rec&#146;d your letter last night and one
        from Amelia today. Glad to hear from you that you are
        well. I wrote you last at Franklin. I am feeling well as
        ever. I told you that if the rebels did not run we would
        have a big fight. Well they did run. We chased them to
        within 2 ½ miles of Columbia. But they run faster than
        we so we came back. Got home last night having been
        without our tents 11 days and it has rained half the
        time. I did not catch cold. Have not had one bad cold
        this winter. I see by John&#146;s letter and
        Amelia&#146;s that Col Park[Josiah Park] is home. I must
        write Stephan. I have often thought of them, but do not
        have time always to write even to you as often as I would
        like to. I won&#146;t write much this time as I have a
        good many to write to.</strong></p>
        <p><strong>I don&#146;t know why the nation should
        tremble at the Conscription Act. Certainly if the nation
        belongs to the people and is worth preserving and if the
        lives of men in the field are worth saving, that very act
        will do it. Men that tremble and doubt at that are not
        true or at least they do not realize the benefits that
        our government has given one and all of us. The army is
        supposed to be and is united and had not the people ought
        to be? I tell you this factious fault finding spirit is
        working our ruin. It is food for the rebels. Their only
        hope of salvation or independence is in the quarreling of
        the North among their own people. It is wrong. It is
        wicked. If the North were a unit this war could not last
        six months. Northern office seekers for the sake of some
        petty place are prolonging this war. and at the same time
        showing us here in the field that we are of no
        consequence or are forgotten.</strong></p>
        <p><strong>I must write to Mallone today. I don&#146;t
        need any money at present my pay is $129 per mo. But I
        have not got my Commission yet. My Pay only commences
        when I get that. I may lose 3 or 4 weeks pay, can&#146;t
        tell. I rec&#146;d a letter from McIntyre[Guy C
        McIntyre], not long ago, he is well, but his leg troubles
        him some yet, it swells.</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Have you made any maple sugar yet. The
        citizens are beginning to make garden. I saw a number
        yesterday sowning seeds. I will close by saying I am well
        and would like to see you all and hope it is less than 6
        months. </strong></p>

        continued good health and prospects. Am getting along
        finely in my new company.</strong><p><strong>Oh! Such

        one today fully leaved. They call it box elder. Peach
        trees are in bloom. I send some buds and blossoms. They
        grew on rebel soil and I suppose are budding traitors.
        Their color though is not butternut.</strong></p>
        <p><strong>We had a grand review and inspection of all
        the Cavalry Force in the Department or nearly all by Maj
        Gen Rosecrans yesterday at 12 M It was a grand sight. The
        Review was on a large common 2 miles from town. There was
        one large flag with the Gen&#146;l and then the
        &quot;star&quot; flags of each Brigadier or Commander of
        Brigade numbered to show which each commanded and then
        most of the different Companies had their Guidions. All
        together made a handsome show with the officers with
        their full uniforms and white gauntlets and red sashes.
        Gen Stanley[David S Stanley] wore a Yellow Sash. The maj
        gen wore none at all. Rosecrans is a large well
        proportioned man, looks about forty five. Is quite bald
        as I could see when he saluted the Brigadiers. He looks
        good-natured and benevolent. Has a large Roman nose
        slightly hooked as he passed us on a gallop with his
        staff. He said &quot;good morning, gentlemen! I am glad
        to see you all out this morning.&quot; And a little
        further on &quot;you are the hope of the army. Do you
        mind that?&quot; and on he went talking along the line
        and encouraging the men. Mrs Rosecrans was at the Review
        also. I was not close to her. She was dressed in black
        and rode a splendid horse. I believe Gen Rosecrans is the
        most popular Gen&#146;l in the army of the Union. He has
        never been whipped and permit me to say he never will be.
        The army in this department has the prestige of success
        and victory and we intend to keep our name good. The
        rumor prevails here at the present that Vicksburg is
        evacuated and the army moving up to crush us out. How
        much truth there is in the report I can&#146;t tell. We
        will be ready for them at any rate. Prospect is that we
        will get pay up to Dec 31 tomorrow. Will get it this
        week, I think without fail. The boys in B Co are all
        well, I believe, I have not heard from John since I wrote
        you last. Direct to Hospital No 8 Nashville. There at
        present, have written to Stephan V. , Elder Bassers and
        quite a no. lately. My love to you all.</strong></p>
        <p><strong>I got out in command of a picket guard 7am
        tomorrow. Good Bye. Write soon. My love to all</strong></p>

        <p><strong>We are having beautiful weather here at
        present. Nice, warm, growing spring days. Much trees are
        all in blossom. <br>
        I am fat and healthy yet like my new company and place
        firstrate. I rec&#146;d a letter from John today saying
        you were all well. I am glad. I often think that before I
        start home some of you may be taken away from this scene
        and stage of action. And I feel sad , and how much more
        you will say. Ought I to think of myself having so much
        more risk to run but you know how natural it is for man
        to put all such thoughts far away with the future, and
        especially the Soldiers, but this is no excuse for any
        man. Human Nature is not reason which should be used. <br>
        I expect to be mustered tomorrow as Lieut. The Col read a
        telegram from the governor saying that my appointment was
        approved and my commission would be sent by mail with a
        no. of others. The Col thinks my commission will date
        from Feb 16. I will rank from that day but do not expect
        to draw pay, only from date of Commission approved is
        rec&#146;d &#150; ie. from yesterday. I intend to be as
        saving as possible. I am making, now, more than I ever
        did before and intend to improve it if my life is spared,
        to benefit all of us. I am earning it easy too. How
        easily I cannot tell but it does not seem to me I should
        be killed. I may be wounded perhaps, you have my
        feelings. I do not feel fearful at all. ----- <br>
        I wish you would send me a lot of stamps they are hard to
        get here at all times. No use to send me papers. John
        writes that Mrs Baker is dead and Egleston very low. How
        is Lafayette getting along? I have written quite a no. of
        letters lately I do not think we will make a forward
        movement right away. I am not sure but that we will have
        to fight here again but hardly think so. The rebels are
        getting saucy. Our whole line of pickets was attacked
        simultaneously yesterday morn but were ready for them.
        Give my love to all, and write all that you are doing and
        going to do. <br>
        From your affectionate son. <br>

        <br>
        Dear Sis<br>
        <br>
        I rec&#146;d your long and good letter yesterday. I was
        glad to hear you were all well. Sorry so many are sick or
        dead. I know Mrs French is dead. Lt Col Park arrived here
        on Friday reported you all are well. Said things were
        about as usual, you could see Ovid yet for the houses. I
        have not heard from Norm S.[Norman Smith: he died the
        next day, Mar 31, &quot;of disease&quot;] in some time.
        He is not well yet. Charley Wrisler of the Colony[Conrad
        Wrisler or Wresler of Duplain: died Mar 24] is dead. He
        died suddenly of Fever. He was as faithful a man as I
        ever knew. He was just promoted to Sergeant in his
        Company. I send my likeness to day by Levi Bigelow. He
        has got his discharge at last. I am glad. The picture is
        not a good one. Too light but I thought perhaps I would
        have no better chance. So I send it along.</strong><p><strong>I
        have not been well the past week. Had some cold and
        chills and fever. But am better now. Got a very sore
        mouth &#150; so that I could not enjoy those delicious
        biscuits and molasses! Oh!</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Well you had a very pleasant and interesting
        acquaintance in you dream. Would not smile or notice you.
        Dr Neitch is a villian.</strong></p>
        <p><strong>I don&#146;t know the use of being lonesome or
        sad and I don&#146;t want you to be. I don&#146;t want to
        come home and see you moping around all you, telling
        everybody you see, Oh! I wish Albert was home. I
        wouldn&#146;t be at home now if I had staid at home. Some
        others would have been here and to shape up these men
        would have been a drafting in Ovid and I might have been
        the first one that would have been pleasant. It is right
        just as it is and it is my duty to be here. Suppose I am
        killed. I have no wife or children left for others to
        care for. And you will have the same good care you have
        always had. But I don&#146;t intend to be killed. The
        rebel was never born that was smart enough to hit me. I
        may die with disease and so I might at home. I am in no
        more dangerous place than I was as Sergeant.</strong></p>
        <p><strong>You may send that box as soon as convenient. I
        had a bite of Maple Sugar that Col Park Josiah B
        Park]brought from his folks. Just as aggravating &#150;
        send me a couple of cotton shirts for under shirts. I
        can&#146;t wear woolen next to me, and some cotton
        stockings and anything else good to eat.</strong></p>
        <p><strong>I have not heard from John[probably John
        Gilbert] in sometime. That is by letter, I don&#146;t
        know why he don&#146;t write. I write him and sent some
        money but he has not answered. Lieut Carter[Julius M
        Carter] saw him and said he was getting along as well as
        possible but could not leave his bed yet.</strong></p>
        <p><strong>I am going to write him today.</strong></p>
        <p><strong>There is no need of Mr Lounsbury&#146;s people
        nursing any hope[Herman H Lounsbury died Dec 31, 1862 in
        Murfreesboro] that Herman is alive. I saw him myself the
        day before he died just as we all went out on a scout.
        And I did not think he would live then. He was moved to
        the hospital the next day which was too much for him and
        he died at night. Hiram Knowles[Hiram J Knowles: also
        died at Mufreesboro May 12, 1863] went down and was
        satisfied.</strong></p>
        <p><strong>There is no signs of a forward movement at
        present. If you send a box direct Lieut. In care of Lt
        Col Park and it will receive more attention, so also with
        letters.</strong></p>
        <p><strong>I must close. Give my love to all my friends
        and all write</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Good bye, Albert</strong></p>
