<p class="MsoNormal">It has been truly said that no words have so thrilled the
Irish heart, since the ever-famous speech of Robert Emmet, in the dock,
September 1803 as those of Thomas Francis Bourke, in the same place, on the 1<sup>st</sup>
of May, 1867<i>.</i></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">No doubt the similarity of the scenes which go into<i> </i>the
immortal history of Ireland's martyrology simultaneously suggested the
comparison between them, to many minds. It was natural. It would have been re­markable,
indeed, if beholding the one, the memories <i>of </i>the other were not conjured
up. Sixty-four years almost had passed, since the devoted young Irish went from
France to revolutionize his country , and give freedom and the means of
happiness and<b> </b>prosper­ity to her oppressed people. Uncontrollable circum<sup>­</sup>stances
baffled his devotion, waylaid his hopes, exposed his plans, frustrated the
result, which should have fol-</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b><br>
122 FENIAN HEROES AND MARTYRS.</b></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">lowed his enthusiastic and carefully devised labors, and<b>
</b>flung him into the relentless jaws of English au­thority, as administered
in Ireland by the infamous Norbury. He died glorying in the sacrifice he was
able to make on the altar of his country<sup>'</sup>s rights; and his wondrous
words are daily given in school-books and &quot;Readers,&quot; with those of the
founders and heroes of the United States, to the boys of the Republic to enliven
their mental marrow with deeds of glory, and strengthen them with faith in love
of country, even unto dying for her.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">The heroism and romantic disinterestedness which we have
been accustomed to regard with a fervor which awoke our pride, not less than our
pity—and pity, the Irish dramatist tells us, is &quot;kin to love &quot;—has
been en-acted over again in these, our supposed prosaic days, This time the hero
went to Ireland, not from France, but from America, guided by similar desires,
fed by as broad a faith, and encouraged by hopes born of facts apparently not
less—actually much more convincing, than those upon which the young
revolutionist of 1803 based his mission to Ireland.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">It is not only a source of consolation, but of hopeful
inspiration, to see the effect produced by the bold and touching words of an
honest man. They are self-con­vincing<i> </i>to the heart of every manly
reader; they need no argument to enforce their truths, or prove the char­acter
of the man who utters them. Thomas Francis Bourke, who had been scarcely
mentioned iii the pub­lic press, before his trial, has leaped into a widely ac­knowledged
pre-eminence; a position which cannot<i> </i>be</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b>COLONEL THOMAS FRANCIS BOURKE. 123</b></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">won<i> </i>simply by fortunate circumstances on the one
hand, or appealingly oppressive treatment on the other. The vital spark of
genius, whether it be manifested in letters, art, science or heroism—for there
is a genius in heroism outside of that other reliable kind mentioned in
gazettes, and based on routine—must be there—must give life to the act or
expressed thought, must give that touch of nature which makes the whole world
kin. Robert Emmet was scarcely known until he never could be known, save by the
record which his genius and his faith made. The name of Thomas Francis Bourke
was scarcely known until it filled all mouths ; and he will, no doubt, be
associated with his day, when those who occupied public attention for years
before it, will be placed on the retired lists of history.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">It is those truths, which anticipate tradition and his­tory,
that lend an interest to the career, whatever it may have been, which preceded
the act which gives or propitiates fame.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Thomas Francis Bourke was born on the 10th De­cember,
1840, in the town of Fethard, county of Tipperary—&quot;Tipperary of the broad
hills and golden val­leys; Tipperary, where the rivers flow like Irish melo­dies,
dividing their chorus with the more rugged and picturesque hills of Waterford,
that seem to grow tame with listening, as the 'rude sea' erst did to the 'dulcet
and harmonious breath' of Oberon's mermaid.&quot; Like many of the very ablest
men, wits, orators and poets, Curran, Moore and Mangan, for instance, and most
devoted and effective patriots, like Wolfe Tone and</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b>124 FENIAN HEROES AND MARTYRS.</b></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">William Putnam<b> </b>McCabe, Bourke sprung from the
people. We learn that both of his parents belonged to the most respectable of
those families, known in Ireland as &quot;the middle class.&quot; His father was
a man of marked intelligence, and more than the average education of persons
engaged in trade. He carried on the painting and decorating business
successfully for many years, and, as well from his cleverness and in­dustry, as
from his family connection with many of the professional men and better class of
farmers, enjoyed a large share of the contracts in his county. No man stood
higher in his community, than the good father of this good son, who was one of
six children. The results of the famine year, which were felt so heavily in the
south and west, materially affected Mr. Bourke's business, so much so indeed,
that emigration from the isle of sorrow was suggested, and accepted as the only
means of affording his young family that present care and future prospect, which
his heart prompted him to give them. In 1850, Mr. Bourke and his fam­ily
arrived in New York, and commenced the world anew. His days were spent in
providing the means of physical sustenance for his children, his evening leisure
hours to the imparting of such literary aliment to them as his early habits
enabled him to bestow. At the end of two years, he had acquired a modest compe­tency,
when the failing health of his wife demanded im­mediate removal; and the
family, leaving New York, settled in St. Johns, Newfoundland, to commence life
for the third time. Mr. Bourke's attention and in­dustry produced their
inevitable reward, and he had</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b>COLONEL THOMAS FRANCIS BOURKE. 125</b></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">succeeded in establishing himself, when his own health gave
way, and a change again became necessary. After two years in St. Johns, he was
obliged to remove to Toronto, Canada West, where a successful relative, a member
of the Provincial Parliament resided.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Meanwhile Thomas Francis had not been idle. He had put his
hand to, and became skilled in his father's business, so much so, that he was
permitted to travel &quot;on his own responsibilities.&quot; He bent his steps
to Boston, where another relative lived and flourished. Here he settled and
worked, and won not only a manly independence for himself, but a surplus, which
he nobly contributed to the family fund at Toronto. His father's health
continued to break ; his exertions had been unremitting, his physical ability
overtasked, in 1858 he became helpless, and thenceforth we are told the entire
support of father, mother, three sisters and a boy brother, devolved solely on
the stout heart and skilful hand of the dauntless youth, the subject of this
sketch, who remitted his bank cheque to Canada with the regularity of Saturday
night's succes­sion. At length the father died, and selling out their pretty
little cottage in the suburbs of Toronto, Mrs. Bourke and her children removed
to New York. Here the girls, now approaching womanhood, found work for their
industrious fingers, and relieved their brother in part, of the burden he had so
loyally and lovingly borne. The family became very happy together, and Mr. M. J.
Heffernan, to whom we are indebted for many of the facts here narrated, gives us
a graphic and touching view of the sayings and doings</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" align="center" style="text-align:center"><b>126 FENIAN
HEROES AND MARTYRS.</b></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">in their humble but happy home. He says it was a great
treat to their few and select friends to visit them of an evening. &quot; Poor
Toni came in from his day's work, with his pleasant smile and his cheery laugh,
and his little sister picked up her books and slate and made way for Tom to kiss
dear mother; and then his grown up sisters come in, and they had such welcome
for each other as though they had been all absent for years. And then they sat
down to tea in such a jolly humor, and talked over old times, and old struggles,
and old friends, and of the little brother at school, in Canada, under the
guardianship of the relative above mentioned; and when the tea things were
removed they read a while from books of their intelligent mother's choosing, and
from the morning papers, which Tom was always sure to fetch home, and from some
national journal, which they received from an unforgetful friend in the old
country. And then they chatted a while, and their fond mother, and one of the
truest types of a true mother, told them stories of a time and a country which
the elder children could not more than remember, and which the young­er ones
never saw; and she related passages of that country's most melancholy history,
and named the books in which the episodes could be found, and they read these
books as soon after as possible; and she told them stories of wrongs and
sufferings, which their race had been made to bear, some printed in books, and
some which were printed nowhere but in the burning memories of Irish people. She
explained to them how it came about that such a race</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b>COLONEL THOMAS FRANCIS BOURKE. 127</b></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">had been so abused, wronged, degraded and despised, and she
there and then made Tom a Fenian! And as the evening wore on, some friend paid a
visit and heard a sweet song sweetly sung. (How charmingly Tom's voice
accompanied those of his beloved sisters!) No silly rhodomontade, but the real <i>thing—'Cushla
Gal Machre' </i>and 'Who fears to speak of Ninety-eight?'<i> </i>And, dear, oh
dear, how poor Tom could sing:</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" align="center" style="text-align:center">'The Green, O, the
Green, 'tis the color of the true!'</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">And then bed-time came, and the favored visitor having
gone, this thrice happy little household knelt down together to mingle their
responses in the Rosary, and offer an united prayer for the repose of the soul
of the dead father. And then they retired for the night, under the shield of
God's special protection—this Irish widow and her Irish children, with their
hearts full of Irish virtue and Irish love.&quot;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">After an absence of three or four years, Bourke re-turned
to New York, about May, 1865. In some re­spects he was greatly developed. His
natural abilities had been expanded by experience with the world, but his
constitution, never strong, was radically impaired. However, lie promptly set
to. work, and soon his quick intelligence was rewarded by the position of
foreman in one of the largest painting firms in the city, with a handsome
salary.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">The Fenian Brotherhood had received a wonderful impetus
during the war. The development of Irish character and bravery, as illustrated
by Corcoran, at Bull-Run, as prisoner of war and subsequently, in</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b>128 FENIAN HEROES AND MARTYRS.</b></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">command<b> </b>of the Irish Legion ; by Mulligan, in his fa­mous
defence of Lexington ; by Meagher and the Irish Brigade; by Shields, who out-manoeuvred
and defeated Stonewall Jackson; by Bryan, who fell at the head of his regiment
at Port Hudson ; by Cass and his &quot; Irish Ninth&quot; of Massachusetts; by
Guiney, who succeeded him, and by Byrnes and his twenty-eighth of the same
State; by Cahill and his Connecticut Irishmen; by Lawlor, of Kentucky; MeGroarty,
of Ohio; Thomas Smythe<b>, </b>of Delaware ; Matthew Murphy, James E. Me-Mahon,
James P. McIver, and many others, had a very powerful effect on the Fenian
organization. This was augmented by the action of England during the war; and
the expectation that hostilities between the United States and the former, would
give the Irish soldier a chance to strike at his old enemy, brought light and
comfort on many a weary march, and nerved him to survive all difficulties, in
view of the long expected day of retribution. This hope caused Fenianism to
spread rapidly, as well in the army as out of it. The military enthusiasm, bred
of experience and the self-reliance it creates, thus infused into the
organization, gave it great hopes and vitality.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">On Bourke's return to New York, he found many of his
associates, both soldiers and Fenians, anxious to put the knowledge of the
former into the cause of the latter. With the teaching of his good mother, under
the shel­ter of the Republic; with the memories of British be­nevolence to
Ireland, in the shape of famine, fever-sheds and oppression, it was not
difficult to enlist him in the great old cause, with the older name. His sym-</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b>COLONEL THOMAS FRANCIS BOURKE. 129</b></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">pathies once aroused, Bourke's every energy followed in the
same direction. Consequently, with his positive talents and manly attributes,
his pride of uprightness and horror of subterfuge, he rose rapidly in the estima­tion
of his brethren of the Wolfe Tone Circle, which he had joined. He was elected a
delegate to the third National Congress, held at Philadelphia, (Oct. 1865,) and
strenuously strove to prevent the change in the Constitution which introduced a
President, Senate and House of Delegates into the organization. His efforts,
however, were not successful ; but the ability and intu­ition exhibited in the
debates, in which he participated, were not lost upon the authorities then
controlling the Brotherhood, and on his return to New York, he was selected as,
and requested to accept the position of, or­ganizer for the District of
Manhattan.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Thomas Bourke at once gave up his excellent em­ployment,
and entered on that path of destiny which he was so well fitted to distinguish.
A natural orator, with that useful education which is always effectively ready,
because self-acquired; with a clear, pleasant voice, and a manner not less
fervid because graceful and easy, Bourke quickly made himself felt in his new
sphere. He never talked from a subject, but at it, and into it, and brought home
to the minds of his hearers the sterling convictions which animated his own. His
sin­cerity and earnestness were strongly indicated by his words and manner, and
gave assurance of unquestiona­ble patriotism and nature's nobility.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">At the time Bourke became organizer, there were some
seventy circles, with ten thousand members, in</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b>130 FENIAN HEROES AND MARTYRS.</b></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">the State of New York. In two months of his
&quot;preaching&quot; as he used to call it, New York city alone had one hundred
and four circles and thirty thousand members in &quot;good standing.&quot; At
the division in the Fenian ranks he remained with the parent organization; was a
delegate to the Fourth National Congress, New York, January, 1866, which
abolished the Presidency and Senate, and reinstated the old constitution ; and
was unanimously elected District Centre for the District of Manhattan, which
embraced the Counties of New York, Westchester, Kings, Queens, Suffolk and
Richmond, in the State of New York, and County of Hudson, in the State of New
Jersey. His days were taken upwith incessant labor in his office on the ground
floor of the celebrated head-quarters, opposite Union Square, while his nights
were not less laboriously devoted to visiting the circles.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">The spring of 1866 was looked forward to by the great body
of the Fenians with a sort of restless expectant enthusiasm. It was hoped that
the rising in Ireland was close at hand, and the government of the Fenians in
New York purchased and fitted out its first vessel for the looked-for Irish
crisis. When this was effected, Bourke's heart became lightened. Contemplating
the prospect of active service, he exclaimed, &quot;Thank God, for I am tired of
preaching!&quot; He was determined to go with the vessel, in striving to
dissuade him from which, Col. O'Mahony, the Head Centre, said:</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&quot; Why, you can be of no use yet, you are not a
sailor.&quot;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b>COLONEL THOMAS FRANCIS BOURKE. 131</b></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&quot;No matter,&quot; said Bourke, &quot;I am resolved to
go, and you must let me. There is surely something that I can do, I can keep
accounts for the paymaster.&quot;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&quot; Very well, then,&quot; said the Head Centre,
&quot;be paymaster yourself.&quot;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><i>&quot;</i>Thank you, sir,&quot; said Bourke.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">On that day, Bourke resigned his District Cen­treship, but
he did not sail for Ireland then. Other divisions following the Campo Bello
adventure, proved disastrous to the plans of the brotherhood. But neither the
faith nor the perseverance of Bourke was shaken. He may have been disgusted, but
he was not disheartened. On the arrival of James Stephens, Bourke again
undertook the continuance of those labors in which he had been so wearied and so
successful, and throughout the summer he remained at his post, making tours of
organization, and assist­ing Mr. Stephens in his attempt to rebuild the
comparatively shattered fabric of Fenianism. He had set his heart too largely on
the matter not to see further into it. He had labored too zealously not to seek
with his own eyes a result. In the Winter, he begged his mother's blessing,
received it in the manner he so proudly alludes to in his speech in the dock,
and started, hoping to aid or make an opportunity whereby the leaders of the
Fenian movement might vindicate their promises.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">The same friend, quoted above, Mr. Heffernan, gives a very
graphic sketch, not only of Col. Bourke's appearance before he started, but of
the views which inspired him to such a course. This is peculiarly</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b>132 FENIAN HEROES AND MARTYRS.</b></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b>interesting, and </b>exhibits <b>in </b>a marked manner
the comprehensive views of duty, as well as of faith, grow­ing out of a clear
head and a fresh heart.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&quot;I met him,&quot; says Mr. Heffernan, &quot;the
evening before he started for Ireland. His bright, intelligent face was pale and
sunken, and his dark, penetrating <i>eyes </i>gleamed with the additional lustre
of a violent fever. His soft, persuasive voice had a deeper tone, which he tried
to make as cheerful as he could, but he was sick—very, very sick, and every
muscle quivered, with pain. His health, never very robust, had begun to fail
early in the summer, just about a year ago, and at the time of his departure,
his buoyant and <b>happy </b>spirit commenced to succumb to the disease which
had slowly but too surely undermined his constitution. His ringing laugh was
growing more moistened, so to speak, every day, and there were moments when his
countenance wore that sad, half sorrowful, half resigned expression, peculiar to
those who <i>feel </i>that their <i>days </i>are not long in the land. I tried
to dissuade him from going to Ireland <i>then, </i>because I knew that his
declining physical strength would. not permit of his undergoing a military cam­paign.
In order further to prevail on him to abandon . his design, I taunted him that
his only motive in going to Ireland must be the desire to redeem his character
from the stain that bad men would try to fasten upon it, on account of his
persistent adherance to Mr. Stephens while he conducted the affairs of the
Fenian Brotherhood in New York<sub>.</sub>.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:10.0pt">&quot;`There,' said the
gallant fellow, `you evince the</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" align="center" style="text-align:center"><br>
<b>COLONEL THOMAS FRANCIS BOURKE. 133</b></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:10.0pt">mistaken notions peculiar to
those who have not studied the question in all its bearings. The preserva­tion
of my honor is but one (and it is the least important) motive, which impels me
to the course which I am about to take, and which I should speedily abandon were
there no higher principle at stake. In the first place, we are not sure that the
movement will be abortive. Providence may throw the neces­sary advantages in
our favor, and where there is even the ghost of a chance, the present desperate
state of affairs demands that we should run the risk. But, allowing the
impossibility of our attaining the great object of our lives at present, a
'rising<sup>'</sup> in Ireland now cannot be otherwise than a success, for it is
indispen­sable to the very life of the cause. Let us see how the case stands.
You know, as well as I do, that the only hope of Ireland's redemption rests with
the 'Irish Nation in America,' and you know that that new nation has the will
and the power to make Ireland<sup>'</sup>s freedom a certainty. You know that so
far from proving this doctrine to be fallacious, the ill-directed and badly
managed Fenian Brotherhood has fully demonstrated what an immense power this new
Irish nation might he under honest and able guidance. Yea know, that in proper
hands, it could tear Ireland from the united grasp of all Europe. But to be of
any use whatever, in that direction, it is absolutely necessary that a clear
understanding should exist between the Irish exiles here, and the patriots who
may still remain on their native soil. They should regard each other with more.
than brotherly love, and</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b>134 FENIAN HEROES AND MARTYRS.</b></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">above all, they must have a firm faith in, and reliance
upon, each other. It matters not now from what cause, but that feeling of mutual
faith and reliance grows weaker and weaker every day. It must be re-inspired and
strengthened at any cost, or effective work for Ireland will be rendered
impossible. The injudicious course hitherto pursued by Mr. Stephens has left the
men at home under a strong impression that they have been abandoned by their
brothers in America. If we allow that impression to remain, they will never
trust us again, and then good-bye to all hope for Ireland 1 It must, I say, be
removed at any cost I Now, who is to remove it ? The wily enemy is now at work,
in press and pulpit, aided by many an `Irish patriot' (God bless the hearers 1)
to weaken the faith of the people, here and at home, in their leaders—to prove
that these leaders have, through sordid and other unworthy motives, led their
confiding followers into a trap, and then abandoned them. It must be confessed
that the conduct of Stephens has given this villainous slander a very plausible
appear­ance of truth. He, having made that disastrous pledge, should have
redeemed it with his life. His failure or folly must completely demoralize the
people, if it be not counteracted. It <i>must </i>be. Kelley, Halpin, M'Cafferty,
and the rest of us—' his associates in crime,' as we are innocently
called—must prove to the people at home that their lives and liberties are not
trifled with by the Irishmen of America. We must prove to them that we are in
earnest—that we are ready to pour out our life-blood, not only to give them</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" align="center" style="text-align:center"><b>COLONEL THOMAS
FRANCIS BOURKE. 135</b></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">freedom, but even to save the common cause from shame and
dishonor. We have had the name of ' leaders,' and it devolves upon us to give
the lie direct to those who would but too gladly say to Irish, men : ' Your
leaders betray you ; beware how you trust them again.' Mutual trust and
confidence, between the Irish ii Ireland and the Irish in America, and between
the people and their leaders MUST be restored. When that is done, the game can
be played over again, with all the advantages on our side of having seen the
enemy's hand. To be sure, it will cost some hundreds of lives, but it will be
well worth the purchase. The blood of her children is the only commodity in
which poor old Ireland is rich.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">But it may be objected that in ruining ourselves and those
who depend on us, we have no moral right to involve the destruction of hundreds
of good men in Ireland, who may follow us into danger and death. I am aware that
quite a number of tender-hearted `patriots' would take this high ground just
now, and they would be perfectly right if those on whom they lavish their cheap
compassion were of the same opinion, which, unfortunately for that merciful argu­ment,
they are not. It would, no doubt, be very pleasant for those, whose malignant
tongues and pens are already prepared to vituperate us in any case, to be able
to say that we <i>`dragged' </i>our poor, ignorant countrymen to perdition,
unshriven and unprepared, in order to redeem our own characters, or through some
other less creditable, personal motive. The facts, however, of which we trust to
you to give a</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" align="center" style="text-align:center"><b>136 FENIAN
HEROES AND MARTYRS.</b></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">plain statement, at the proper time, will utterly belie the
assertions that we are urged to this course by any selfish consideration
whatever, or even that impru­dence had any share in the matter. You are aware
that within the past two months we have received despatches from every district
in Ireland, all bearing the same burden—all chorusing the same tune—all
beseeching us to go to them at once, no matter what means we possessed, and help
them to fight the good fight, which they would immediately inaugurate with-out
us in case we failed to be at their head. If we oppose them now, our own
brothers in Ireland will be the most persistent and vehement maligners of the
Irish race in America. What will be the result ? The men at home will never
trust us again, and then, I repeat, farewell to Irish Regeneration! They, not
we, are <i>forcing </i>this business ; but, God willing, if they go down, we,
who first raised their hopes, will go down with them—aye, no matter how far
down they may go 1 Therefore, I go to Ireland—feeble and prostrate <b>as </b>I
am in body, I shall go to Ireland, and were I obliged to be <i>carried </i>through
the fields, I shall be in the thick of the first fight ! My comrades and myself,
with a full belief in the ultimate triumph of our holy cause, go to offer up our
lives—not even for the immediate consummation of our dearest hopes, but for
the eradication of that distrust and want of true fraternal feeling, whose seeds
the enemy has scattered broadcast amongst us, and for the establishment of that
love of one another and kindly forbearance of each other's faults and follies,
without which the</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b>COLONEL THOMAS FRANCIS BOURKE 137</b></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Irish race will ever be the shackled shame of mankind. We
give our lives as an offering of purification, that our cause may be cleansed
from the pollution of its enemies—that it may be lifted from the filthy slough
into which it has been cast, and placed as high beyond the touch of the venal
and corrupt, as it is to-day beneath the notice of those who are sincere and
worthy. It behoves you who remain behind to see that this willing offering is
not made in vain. On with the good work! Begin over again, and we'll fight it
out on this line! Farewell! &quot;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">He<b> </b>went to give his young life as an &quot; offering
of purification,&quot; for the &quot;eradication of distrust,&quot; for the
es-tablishment of mutual love and &quot;kindly forbearance.&quot;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">These parting words of Colonel Bourke, show him to have
sounded the depths of Irish necessity, and to have struck the key- note of Irish
success. He went to a sacrifice to show others how to go to a success.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">In the distribution of the district commands, Colonel
Bourke was assigned to the Tipperary District. The general rising, as agreed
upon, took place on the 5th March, 1867, and under that date, was issued from
the &quot;Head-Quarters I. R. Army, Limerick Junction, Tip­perary,&quot; the
following proclamation, the main characteristics of which will not lead us to
err in assigning it to Colonel Bourke:</p>
<p class="DefinitionList"><span style="font-size:10.0pt">&quot;Soldiers,--The
hour for which you have longed has come at last. You are now about to confront
the enemies of your country and your race. You must not expect material aid from
without until you have shown the friends of Republican Liberty, by deeds, not
words, that you are worthy their sympathy.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b>138 FENIAN HEROES AND MARTYRS.</b></p>
<p class="DefinitionList"><span style="font-size:10.0pt">&quot;You are not so
well armed as you might be, * * * but you will remember that history furnishes
no instance of revo­lution, when the insurgents took the field as well armed as

<p class="MsoNormal">The Government was prepared for the rising. It had in its
pay since the September previous, the now noto­riously infamous informer, John
Joseph Corydon, who had been used as a despatch messenger between the leaders on
both sides of the Atlantic, for nearly two years. This Corydon set the
authorities on the track of Patrick Condon, alias Godfrey Massey, who acted in
the capacity of traveling agent, or adjutant-general of Colonel Thomas J.
Kelley, the acting C. O. I. R. He became likewise an informer, and his evidence
con­victed Bourke, who was captured at the affray at Bally­hurst Fort, near
Tipperary, on the 6th March. Bourke<sup>'</sup>s graces of manner won even the
good-will of his cap-tors. On his deportation, for trial, to Dublin, Major Lind,
of the 31st regiment, shook hands with him, say­ing : &quot; Good-bye, General
Bourke ; I wish you good</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b>COLONEL THOMAS FRANCIS BOURKE. 139</b></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">fortune.&quot; Bourke replied : &quot;I wish you the same,
Ma­jor, and thank you for the kindness you have extended to me.&quot;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">The Special Commission sat in Dublin on the 10th April,
when the prisoners, against whom bills of indict­ment had been found, were
placed at the bar, in order to receive the necessary notice of trial, and to
have coun­sel assigned them. By direction of the Lord Chief Jus­tice, Thomas
F., known as &quot;General&quot; Bourke, was the first placed at the bar. His
Lordship then informed him that the grand jury had found bills of indictment for
high treason against him ; that he was entitled to copies of the indictment,
lists of the jurors, and of the wit­nesses against him; also, that he would
have ten clear days to consider his defence, and was at liberty to name two
counsel, who would be assigned by the court. Colonel Bourke selected Messrs,.
Butt and Downes as his counsel, and Mr. Lawless as his attorney.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">The indictment found by the grand jury, which con­sisted
of four counts, may be here condensed, as it re­fers</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">not only to Bourke, but to other noted Fenians, whose names
it preserves, and who will be referred to in subsequent chapters.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">The first count sets forth the general charge against the
accused, as follows : &quot; The Jurors for our Lady the Queen, upon their oath

their hearts, but being moved and seduced by the instiga­tion of the devil, as
false traitors against our said Lady the Queen, and wholly withdrawing the
allegiance, fidelity and obedience, which every true and faithful subject of our
said Lady the Queen should and of right ought to bear towards our said Lady the
Queen, to wit, on the 11th day of July, in the year of our Lord one thousand

together a great number of false traitors, to the number of three thousand, in
order to raise rebellion and insurrection therein, and to seize on, take, and
carry away a quantity of guns, pistols and other mili­tary weapons, the
property of her Majesty, wherewith they might the better arm themselves, and
fight against the troops and soldiers of our said Lady the Queen.&quot;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">The next section of the first count charges that the
accused did conspire with the persons named, and other false traitors, to raise,
levy and make insurrection, re­bellion and war against the Queen, and
&quot;with force and arms, at the Parish of Tallaght, in the County of Dublin,
maliciously and traitorously did arm them-selves with, and bear and carry

themselves with divers other false traitors, armed with guns, pistols and pikes,
whose names are to the said jurors unknown, for the purpose of raising, levy­ing
and making public insurrection, rebellion and war against our said Lady the
Queen, and of committing and perpetrating a cruel slaughter of and amongst the
faithful subjects of our said Lady the Queen, within this realm.&quot;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">The subsequent sections charge the prisoners with having
attacked the police at Glencullen, Stepaside. Kilmallock, Ballyknockane,
Ballyhurst and Drogheda.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">The second count repeats the same overt acts as in the
first count, omitting the words &quot; being subjects of our Lady the Queen, not
regarding the duty of their allegiance,<sup>&quot;</sup> and the words &quot;
wholly withdrawing the</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">allegiance, fidelity and obedience which every true and
faithful subject of our said Lady the Queen should and of right ought to bear
towards our said Lady the Queen.&quot;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">The third count charges that the accused and others did
traitorously assemble and make war against the Queen in the County Dublin; and
the fourth again sets out the illegal acts relative to the attack upon the
police barracks at Glencullen, etc., where the accused &quot;did arm and array
themselves in a warlike manner, and did then and there make a warlike attack
upon and fire at a body of constables, then and there lawful­ly assembled in
the due execution of their duty, and then and there did make a warlike attack
upon a cer­tain dwelling-house and barrack, in which divers con-stables of her
Majesty then were, and did call on and demand said constables to surrender to
the Irish Re-public, and did fire upon said constables, and then did compel the
said constables to surrender the said house to them, the said traitors.&quot;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">In the list of witnesses to be produced <i>by the </i>Crown,
against the prisoners indicted for high treason at the Special Commission, and
to be resumed on Wednes­day, the 24th of April, when the trial of the Fenian
prisoners would proceed forthwith, were the following persons connected with the
United States of America. They are thus described, amongst over two hundred
others: Patrick Condon, otherwise called Godfrey Massey, formerly a colonel in
the Confederate Army of the Southern States of North America; afterwards a
canvasser for a commercial house in New Orleans, and</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" align="center" style="text-align:center"><b>144 FENIAN
HEROES AND MARTYRS.</b></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">at present no occupation; formerly Phelan's <i>coffee-</i>house,
at New Levee, in the city of New Orleans, America; afterwards Tavistock street,
in the county of Middlesex, in England, and now the of<sup>f</sup>ice of the
Metropolitan Police, Lower Castle Yard, county of the city of Dublin. John
Joseph Corydon, formerly a lieutenant in the United States of America, and at
present no profession ; late the Commercial Hotel, Is­lington, Liverpool, in
England, and now the station of the Metropolitan Police, Chancery lane, county
of the <i>city of </i>Dublin. John Devany, formerly a clerk in a mercantile
establishment in New York, and at present no profession ; late Ridge street, New
York, in the United States of America, and now the station of the Metropolitan
Police, Chancery lane, county of the <i>city </i>of Dublin.<br>
The trial commenced on the 24th of April. The following evidence was elicited:<br>
It was proved by one Edward Brett, a servant of Mr. James Bartel, of Thomastown,
that having been sent for bread on the morning of the 6th March, he was stopped
on his return, and from statements made to him he brought the bread to
Ballyhurst Fort, where Bourke, who was lame, distributed it among the men.
Sub-inspector Wm. Kelly, who had seen Bourke in the month previous, described
him as &quot; a man with a broken up constitution, and not capable of much
physical exertion.</p>
<p class="DefinitionList"><span style="font-size:10.0pt">William Woodworth,
color-sergeant 31st Regiment, examined: I was stationed at Tipperary, on the
afternoon of the 6th March last. I went out with about sixty men to Ballyhurst
Fort. I saw</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b>COLONEL THOMAS FRANCIS BOURKE. 145</b></p>
<p class="DefinitionList"><span style="font-size:10.0pt">a large number of men
emerging from it in twos and threes. As we approached the fort, we were fired
upon by men in the fort. I saw a single horseman in the fort. He moved <i>away </i>in
an oblique direction from the rest of the mob. As he rode away he was fired upon
by several of the men. I observed him fall or dismount from his horse. We
closely pursued him. Privates Squires and Dickens were under my command. With me
they overtook him behind a hedge. I identify that person as the pris­oner
Bourke. He had a stick in his hand and appeared to be lame. I did not lose sight
of him from the time I first saw him until he dismounted. There were no persons
near him but soldiers when we arrested him.</span></p>
<p class="DefinitionList"><span style="font-size:10.0pt">Win. Roberts,
color-sergeant 31st, deposed that he searched the prisoner Bourke, and found
with him a pocket-book and two documents. In the pocket-book was inscribed the
following oath: &quot;In the presence of Almighty God, I solemnly swear that I
will not bear arms against, or by word or net give information, aid or comfort
to the enemies of the Irish Republic, until regularly relieved of this
obligation. So help me God.&quot; The two docu­ments were lists of names.</span></p>
<p class="DefinitionList"><span style="font-size:10.0pt">On cross-examination
the witness stated that the man on <sup>'</sup>horse-back was three hundred
yards away from him when the men fired, and that at that distance he could not
recognize him.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Another account, written on authority, varies little from
the depositions on the trial, but sufficient to give Bourke full credit for the
position in which he was cap­tured, and says : &quot; The fo<sup>r</sup>ce of
the 31st, which acted there under Major Lynd, did not at first fire a
single-shot, but charged up a hill against the Fenian insurgents, intending to
attack them with the bayonet. The latter bolted away, and the soldiers, after a
long ran after them, saw them gathered together at some distance off. Marksmen
were then ordered to the front, and-knelt down and fired, and several Fenians</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b>146 FENIAN HEROES AND MARTYRS.</b></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">were wounded. <i>It is not a fact that the rebel called '
Coronel' Bourke surrendered. </i>He was on a horse trying<sub>,</sub><i> to</i>
rally his men when a sergeant took aim and fired at him, and it is supposed that
he wounded the horse from which Bourke fell. Bourke was afterwards found on a
truss <i>of </i>straw, and was arrested.<sup>&quot;</sup></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">The evidence <i>of </i>the informers, Godfrey Massey, and
John Joseph Corydon, on the trial <i>of </i>General Bourke, referring to many
other Fenian heroes and martyrs, is given substantially in full from the
reports, leaving out the questions which elicited the narratives. The same
evidence in its main features was given by them on the trials <i>of </i>the
others identified and convict&#8209;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">ed <i>by </i>them.</p>
<p class="DefinitionList"><span style="font-size:10.0pt">Patrick Condon, <i>alias
</i>Godfrey Massey, was called.</span></p>
<p class="DefinitionList"><span style="font-size:10.0pt">On the witness
ascending the table, the prisoner, General Bourke, changed his position in the
dock, and looked Massey straight in the face, but the latter turned his <i>eye </i>aside.
The witness stated that he was a colonel in the 2d Texas regiment, Confederate
service, afterwards a canvasser for a commercial house in New Orleans ; that he
became connected with the Fenian Brotherhood about August, 1865, and went to New
York in October, 1806. be first saw Bourke, whom he now identified, in the
Central Fenian Office, 19 Chatham street, New York. He met Stephens there also.
He continued: I was at a Fenian meeting in Philadelphia. Steps were there taken
for the purpose of collecting war materials and money. An officer was appointed
to take charge of the materials. The }war materials were to be sent to New York,
for shipment to Ireland. Stephens and I left Philadelphia and went to
Washington. We there met some men belonging to the organization, and consulted
them. I know that James Stephens was connected with the Fenian Brotherhood. That
portion of it which began with John O'Mahony, was under his direction. I have
known the prisoner, Bourke, as</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b>COLONEL THOMAS FRANCIS BOURKE. 147</b></p>
<p class="DefinitionList"><span style="font-size:10.0pt">Colonel Thomas Bourke,
or Colonel Thomas F. Bourke, in America. I knew very well a person named Colonel
Kelley. I gave money to Colonel Thomas F. Bourke. I gave him about £10 in
London. I stated to him when I gave him the money the purpose, which was that he
should come with me to Ireland to join the rising ; that was some weeks previous
to the 11th February last. He said that he had to leave London for Ireland on
the evening of the day in which h? would receive the money. After I left
Washington, I went to New York. I arrived there before Stephens by a few days.
On Stephens' return, there was a meeting of the Fenians held at New York. About
the middle of December, 1866, there was a Fenian meeting held. Some of the Irish
Centres were present. General Halpin was present. I cannot think of the names of
all, but about thirty were present. I am not sure whether the prisoner, Colonel
Bourke, was there. Stephens presided at the meeting. Stephens made a statement.
showing the amount of war material held by the Brotherhood at New York. He said
that the amount was not one-seventh of the minimum fixed by himself. He said
that the mini-mum was thirty thousand rifles. He objected to open the fight, as
he had promised, but to prove his fidelity to Ireland, he offered to come <i>over
</i>and put himself in the hands of the police authorities, and to be hanged.
That proposition was scouted by every one, and it was determined that the fight
should be opened. I knew a person named Captain M'Cafferty. He was at that
meeting. Some even­ings after that, Stephens convened another meeting. About
twenty officials were present at that meeting. It was purely a military one.
M'Cafferty wanted to <i>know </i>the plan of the campaign. Stephens did not like
to mention it. I said that M<sup>'</sup>Cafferty was right, and supported his
motion to divulge the plan of the campaign to his officers. That was what turned
out afterwards to be the campaign for Ireland. At that meeting several of the
officers said that they would leave on the next day, Saturday, for Ireland, and
they did. There was a list of names of officers who were to go to Ireland made
out. I got that list of names from Colonel Kelley. He then held the position of
C. O. I. B. be was the deputy of Stephens. C. O. L It. signified &quot;Chief
Organizer of the Irish Republic.&quot; After the time of the first meeting, some
of the officers left for Ireland. I do</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b>148 FENIAN HEROES AND MARTYRS.</b></p>
<p class="DefinitionList"><span style="font-size:10.0pt">not remember the names
of those who left for Ireland. After that meeting I attended a meeting at
Stephens' lodgings, West Eleventh street. James Stephens was present, so were
Colonel Kelly, Cap­tain O'Shea, and others. I know the district of Manhattan.
At a subsequent meeting, Stephens was deposed and repudiated, and Col­onel
Kelly was put in his stead. I left New York on 11th January of the present year.
I took shipping for England, from Portland, in the State of Maine. Before
leaving New York, I received from Col­onel Kelly £550 in gold, (British
money,) to be distributed among the officers in Ireland. The list I referred to
a few minutes ago, I destroyed. When I arrived here I met the officers whose
names Colonel Kelly disclosed to me, and in accordance with instructions I gave
them the moneys. I arrived in Liverpool on the 20th Janu­ary, in the present
year. I remained there for a day, and then pro­ceeded to London, where I
stopped at private lodgings until the 11th February. Amongst the officers whose
names Colonel Kelly disclosed to me, and whom I met in London, was the prisoner,
Thomas Bourke, who was appointed to the Tipperary district. Captain O'Brien and
Dominick O'Mahony were officers for Cork. Captain Deasy was for the Mill-street
district. A man named Joyce was offi­cer for Fermoy. General Halpin was for the
Dublin district. I do not know that there was any one mentioned for Louth or
Drogheda. Colonel Kelly lodged in 5 Upper Creswell street, London. I saw there
General Fariola, a Franco-Italian, and a person named Cluseret. I knew General
Halpin well. I saw there Beirne or O'Beirne, from Dublin, Mahony, .from Cork,
and Ha<sup>r</sup>bison, from Belfast, who said they were delegates or
representatives of the Fenian Brother-hood in Ireland. I gave them money; £30
would cover what each got. I stated to them that the money was given for the
support of the organization. At that meeting an address was drawn up con-jointly
by three. It was discussed as they went along—that is, para­graph by
paragraph. It spoke about the wrongs of Ireland, and called upon the people to
take up arms, and invoking the sympathy and aid of the working men of England. I
came to Dublin on the 11th February. There was a meeting of Centres hold the
next day. O'Beirne was there. The Centres stated the numerical strength,
material of war, and the number of arms held by each. I</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b>COLONEL THOMAS FRANCIS BOURKE. 149</b></p>
<p class="DefinitionList"><span style="font-size:10.0pt">took the returns myself
of the respective Centres then and there assembled.</span></p>
<p class="DefinitionList"><span style="font-size:10.0pt">What did they state the
numerical strength was? About four-teen thousand.</span></p>
<p class="DefinitionList"><span style="font-size:10.0pt">And the material of war
and arms? About three thousand stand of arms—to consist of rifles, guns and
pikes. The next day I went into the county Mayo, first to Castlebar, then to
Westport, where I<sub> </sub>stopped one night. I then returned to Dublin,
thence to Cork, where a Fenian meeting was held on the outskirts of the town,
con­vened by O'Mahony, the same I gave the money to in London. The numerical
strength given me in Cork, was twenty thousand men, and about one thousand five
hundred weapons, the vast ma­jority of them pikes. I left Cork the next day for
the town of Tip­perary, for the purpose of acquiring a knowledge of the country
for military purposes. I next returned to Dublin, and then left for Lon-don. I
went to Colonel Kelly's lodgings. Kelly gave me some more money to be
distributed. He told me the rising was fixed for the 5th of March, that being
the anniversary of the day on which some of the persons taken in Canada were
sentenced to be executed. Told me that the railroad centres were to be
destroyed, if they could not be held by the insurgents. <b>A </b>guerrilla war
was to be maintain­ed, and the railways destroyed by the insurgents. I left
London on the morning after my arrival, and returned to Dublin, for a day or
two. I then went to Mullingar, for military pu<sup>r</sup>poses. On my <i>re-</i>turn
to Dublin a meeting of Fenian Centres was held, at some dis­tance from Porto
Bello Barracks. O<sup>'</sup>Beirne was there. Told him the night of the 5th
March was fixed for the rising. On the next day went to Cork, where I saw
O'Mahony, to whom I said that the 5th of March had been fixed upon for the
rising. Soon after I left Cork, and went to the Limerick Junction, where I was
arrested, on the railway platform, on the night of the 4th March.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">On the cross-examination, Counsellor Butt forced Massey to
acknowledge the disgrace both of his moth­er and wife. He proved he was the
illegitimate son</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b>150 FENIAN HEROES AND MARTYRS.</b></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">of the fo<sup>r</sup>mer by one Massey, and that the latter
pressed him to become an informer.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">The statement of the other wretch, Corydon, whose brazen <i>nonchalance

appointment and also a man named Flood ; I next saw M'Cafferty a few days before
the Chester affair; Flood and all the American officers in Liverpool were there
; the meeting was held at the house of a man named Walsh in Edgar street ;
M'Cafferty and Flood said they were sent from the directory in London, with
money to pay their way to Chester; they said that the American officers in
Liverpool would go to Chester ; that the castle there was to be attacked, the
arms seized, a train seized, and the arms put into it of course ; the rails were
to be taken up and the wires also, and they were to proceed by train to Holyhead,
where they would seize the mail boat and land in Ireland ; that plan was agreed
to at the meeting ; no arrange­ments for carrying it out were made ; after the
meeting separated, and on the Sunday before the Monday, I gave information to
the authorities in Liverpool, I made arrangements to go to Chester; all the
American officers, about twenty,. went to Chester ; I saw them at Birkenhead ; I
went there with them ; I met Austin Gibbons, one of the American officers at
Birkenhead; a counter­mand of the order to march on Chester was given by
Gibbons ; he told me that the thing was &quot; sold ;&quot; that some one had
inform­ed; he said that M'Cafferty sent to him to tell them all in Liverpool
that the thing was &quot; sold,&quot; and they were to go back ; after that,
late in February, I got orders to come to Dublin; I remained there until the
Intended rising ; I came to Dublin ; I knew Colonel Godfrey Massey ; I saw him
after I came to Ireland ; I was order­ed to go to Millstreet, (Cork) ; I was so
ordered by Massey and Duffy ; I was told to go to Millstreet and see the &quot;
Centre&quot; there, a man named Kearney ; that he would give me instructions how
to act, and through him to find my way to Colonel O'Connor in Kerry ; I was
desired to tell O'Connor about the rising to take</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal">On the 1st of May, the Chief Justice charged the jury,
which after having been out from half past three to five minutes before six o<sup>'</sup>clock,
brought in a verdict of guilty.. Having been asked the usual question, if he had
anything to say why judgment and execution should not be pronounced, the
prisoner, says the re-port, who spoke throughout in a<sup>,</sup> clear, firm
and im­pressive manner, and whose style of expression was manifestly that of a
man who possessed a refined and educated mind, said:</p>

<p class="DefinitionList"><span style="font-size:10.0pt">My Lords it is not my
intention to occupy much of your time in answering the question why the sentence
of the court should not now be passed on me. But I may, with your permission,
review a little of the evidence that has been brought against me. The first
evidence that I would speak of, is that of Sub-Inspector Kelly, who had the
conversation with me in Clonmel, in Tipperary. He states that he asked either
&quot;How was my friend,&quot; or &quot; What about my friend Stephens,&quot;
and that I made answer and said he was the most idolized man that ever had been,
or ever would be, in America. Here, standing on the brink of my grave, in the
presence of the Almighty and Ever-Living God, I brand that as being the foulest
perjury that ever man gave utterance to. No such conversation ever occurred. The
name of Stephens was not mentioned. I shall pass from that, and then touch on
the evidence of Britt. He states that I assisted in distributing the bread to
the parties in the fort, and that I stood with him in the wagon or cart. That is
also false. I was not in the fort at the time at all ; I was not there when the
bread was being distributed. I came in afterwards. Both of these asser­tions
have been made, and submitted to the men in whose hands my life rested, as
evidence, made on oath, by these men—made solely and purely for the purpose of
giving my body to an untimely grave. (The prisoner here, evidently to refresh
his memory, looked at a little bit of paper in his hand, on which he had taken a
few notes of the evidence during the trial.) There are many points, my lords,
that have been sworn to here, to prove my complicity in a great many acts, it
has been alleged I took part in. It is not my desire now, my lords, to give
utterance to one word against the verdict which has been pronounced upon me. But
fully conscious of my honor as a man, which has never been impugned—fully
conscious that I can go into my grave with a name and character unsullied—I
can only say this : that these parties, actuated by a desire either for their
own aggrandizement, or to save their paltry, miserable lives, have pandered to
the appetite, if I may so speak, of justice; and my life shall be the forfeit.
Fully convinced and satisfied of the righteous­ness of my every act in
connection with the late revolutionary move­ment in Ireland, I have nothing to
recall—nothing that I would not do again—nothing that would bring up the
blush of shame to man-</span></p>
<p class="DefinitionList"><b>COLONEL THOMAS FRANCIS BOURKE. 155</b></p>
<p class="DefinitionList"><span style="font-size:10.0pt">tle my brow; my conduct
and career, both here and in America—if you like, as a soldier—are before
you, and even in this my hour of trial, I feel the consciousness of having lived
an honest man; and I will die proudly, believing that if I have given my life to
give freedom and liberty to the land of my birth, I have done only that which
every Irishman and every man whose soul throbs with a feel­ing of liberty
should do. I, my lords, shall scarcely—I feel I should not at all—mention
the Dame of Massey. I feel I should not pollute my lips with the name of that
traitor, whose illegitimacy has been proved here; a man whose name even is not
known, and who I deny point-blank, ever wore the star of a colonel in the
Confede­rate army. Him I shall let rest. I shall pass him, wishing him, in the
words of the poet</span></p>

<p class="DefinitionList"><span style="font-size:10.0pt">Let Massey remember
from this day forth, he carries with him, as my learned and eloquent counsel
(Mr. Dowse) has stated, a serpent that will gnaw his conscience—will carry
about with him in his breast a living hell, from which he can never be
separated. I, my lords, have no desire for the name of a martyr. I seek not the
death of a martyr; but if it is the will of the Almighty and Omnipotent God that
my devotion to the land of my birth should be tested on the scaffold, I am
willing there to die in defence of the right of men to free government—the
right of an oppressed people to throw off the yoke of thraldom. I am an Irishman
by birth, an American by adoption, by nature a lover of freedom, and an enemy to
that power that holds my native land in the bonds of tyranny. It has so - often
been admitted that the oppressed have a right to throw off the yoke of
oppression, even by English statesmen, that I deem it unne­cessary to advert to
that fact in a British court of justice. Ireland's children are not—never
were—and never will be—willing or sub-missive slaves, and so long as
England's flag covers one inch of Irish soil, just so long will they believe it
to be a Divine right &quot;to conspire, imagine and devise &quot; means to hurl
it from power, And erect in its stead the God-like structure of self-government.

<p class="MsoNormal"><b>156 FENIAN HEROES AND MARTYRS.</b></p>
<p class="DefinitionList"><span style="font-size:10.0pt">I go any further, I
have one important duty that I wish to dispose of. To my learned, talented and
eloquent counsel, I oiler that poor gift—the thanks—the sincere and grateful
thanks of an honest man; I offer him, too, in the name of America, the thanks of
the Irish people. I know that I am here without a relative—without a friend,
in fact—three thousand miles away from my family. But I know that I am not
forgotten there. The great and generous Irish 'heart of America to-day feels
for--to-day sympathizes with, and does not forget t<sub>h</sub>e man who is
willing to tread the scaffold—aye, defi­antly—proudly conscious of no
wrong—in defence of American principles—In defence of liberty. I now, to Mr.
Butt, Mr. Dowse, Mr. O'Loghlen—all my counsel, one of whom was, I believe, Mr.
Curran—and my able solicitor, Mr. Lawless—I return to them, individually and
collectively, my sincere and heartfelt thanks. I shall now, my lords, as no
doubt you will suggest the propriety of; turn my attention to the world beyond
the grave. I shall now look on to that home where sorrows are at an end—where
joy is eternal. I shall hope and pray that freedom may yet dawn on this poor
down-trodden country. That is my hope and my prayer; and the last words I shall
utter will be a prayer to God for forgiveness, and a prayer for poor old
Ireland. Now, my lords, in relation to the other man, Corydon, I will make a few
remarks. Perhaps before I go to Corydon, I should say, much has been spoken on
that table of Colonel Kelly, and of the meeting held at his quarters or lodgings
in London. I desire to state, I never knew where Colonel Kelly's lodgings were,
and I never knew where he lived in London, until I heard the informer, Massey,
announce it on the table. I never at-tended a meeting at Colonel Kellys, and the
hundred other state­ments about him, that has been made to your lordships, and
to you, gentlemen of the jury, I now solemnly declare, on my honor as a
man—aye, as a dying man—these statements to have been totally unfounded and
false from beginning to end. In relation to the small paper that was introduced
here and brought against me, as evidence, as having been found on my person, in
connection with that oath, I desire to say, that paper was not found on my
person, and I knew no person whose name was on that paper. O'Byrne, of Dublin,
or those other persons you have heard of, I never saw</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b>COLONEL THOMAS FRANCIS BOURKE. 157</b></p>
<p class="DefinitionList"><span style="font-size:10.0pt">nor met. That paper has
been put in there for some purpose. I can swear positively it was not in my hand
writing ; I can also swear I never saw it, yet it is used as evidence against
me. Is this justice ? Is this right ? Is this manly ? I am willing, if I have
transgressed the laws, to suffer the punishment; but I object to this system of
trumping up a case, to take away the life of a human being. True, I ask for no
mercy. My present emaciated form—my constitution somewhat shattered—it is
better that my life should<sub>,</sub> be brought to an end, than to drag out a
miserable existe<sub>n</sub>ce in the prison pens of Portland. Thus it is, my
lords, I accept the verdict. Of course my acceptance of it is unnecessary ; but
I am satisfied with it. And now I shall close. True it is there are many
feelings that actuate me at this moment. In fact, these few disconnected remarks
can give no idea of what I desire to state to the court. I have ties to bind me
to life and society, as strong as any man in this court. I have a family I love
as much as any man in this court does his. But I can remember the blessing
received from an aged mother's lips, as I left her the last time. She spoke as
the Spartan mother did—&quot; Go, my boy. Return either with <b>your </b>shield
or upon it.&quot; This reconciles me. This gives me heart. I submit to my doom,
and I hope that God will forgive me my past sins. I hope, too, that inasmuch as
He has for seven hundred years, preserved Ireland, notwithstanding all the
tyranny to which she has been subjected, as a separate and distinct nationality,
He will also retrieve her fallen fortunes—to rise in her beauty and her
majesty, the sister of Columbia, the peer of any nation in the world.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">The prisoner here ceased, and stepped back from the front
of the dock, just as calmly as he had advanced to it, but with perhaps a slight
additional lustre in his eye, and a heightened color. Throughout he never
hesitated for a word, but spoke slowly, distinctly and deliberately, to the end.
He was listened to through-out with breathless anxiety. A murmur of applause and
delight with his eloquent and touching address,</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b>158 FENIAN HEROES AND MARTYRS.</b></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">arose amid the audience, as he stepped back, but it was, of
course, instantly suppressed by the officials.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">The sentence of the law for high treason was then
pronounced, that the prisoner be hanged, drawn and quartered, on Wednesday, the
29th May.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">In appearance, Thomas Francis Bourke was striki<sup>n</sup>g,
even though enfeebled by disease. About five feet ten inches in height, with a
slight stoop recently contracted, his earnest manner gave his actions a spirit
of enthusiasm which was greatly heightened by his eye (full but not prominent),
when anything occurred to stir his natural genius. He was deeply imbued with a
religions feeling, both of sentiment and action. On the night before his trial
he wrote the following strong, touching, and beautiful letter :</p>
<p class="DefinitionList"><b><span style="font-size:10.0pt">DEARLY BELOVED
MOTHER : </span></b><span style="font-size:10.0pt">Long before this reaches you,
my sentence, I presume, will have been made known to the American world by the
Atlantic cable. This is the night before my trial, and what that sentence may be
I do not know ; but I am resigned and prepared to meet, <i>in a manner that
becomes your son </i>and my own manhood, whatever God in his mercy has destined
for me. in Him are all my hopes, and He will not desert me in my hour of trial,
nor you in your deep affliction ! 0, my dear, dear mother ! there is only one
thought that almost unmans me, and that is, I, who was only happy in your
happiness, should, in your declining years, cause you even a moment's pang of
sorrow ! But, as this transitory life is at best, 'but a vale of tears and
suffering, you have before your eyes the grief and unspeakable affliction of
that Holy Mother who gave up her Divine Son to crucifixion for the redemption of
man's immortal soul ; and she who is now a mother to me, will be to you the
Refuge and Comforter of the Afflicted.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b>COLONEL THOMAS FRANCIS BOURKE. 159</b></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Again, here is the record of a loving thought and
comforting fact :</p>
<p class="DefinitionList"><span style="font-size:10.0pt">&quot;I have carefully
guarded and preserved the <i>Agnus Dei which </i>you suspended round my neck at
our parting * * * On<b> </b>last Easter Sunday I partook of Holy Communion at a
late Mass. I counted the difference of time between this longitude and yours,
for I knew that you and my dear sisters were partaking of <i>the </i>Sacrament
at early Mass on that day, as was your wont, and I felt that our souls were in
communion together !&quot;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">As anything relating to the young hero is enter­taining,
and especially all that illustrates his internal nature, the following
reminiscences of one who obtain­ed admission into his cell in Kilmainham Jail,
while under sentence of death, will be- particularly appro­priate and
interesting :</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&quot; A warder paced without in the passage. I went over
and looked within, and lying on a hammock, with a little table beside him, upon
which stood a crucifix, a vase of holy water and some books, was the nearest of
the ` Irish felons<sup>'</sup> to death.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&quot; His quick eye noted me at once. He had a book in his
hand. He laid it down. He raised himself by a cord attached to the lower end of
his conch. I took it as an invitation to enter, and I beckoned the warder.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&quot; The door was unbarred, and I walked forward. A. few
words were responded by me, and I sat down. The hammock in which he lay was
swung from iron hooks fastened in the walls of his cell, and extended
transversely across that apartment. Beyond was the straw pallet in which the
prisoner used to lie at night.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b>&nbsp;<o:p>
</o:p>
</b></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b>160 FENIAN HEROES AND MARTYRS.</b></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">The book which he had been reading on my entrance lay open
upon the couch. I looked at its heading, and it was the `Preparation for Death,'
by St. Alphon­sus Ligouri.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&quot; I saw no change in Thomas Bourke the condemned and
Thomas Bourke on trial. Self-possessed and calm as ever, he spoke quietly,
firmly and gently. His<b> </b>observations were given almost invariably in
reply. In the life of the informers he could see noth­ing worth living for,
when they had outlived their honor and foreswore their oaths ; so he gave his
dictum, and I believed him. I spoke of his worn and enfeebled state of health,
for I had special reasons for so doing. He told me it was his souvenir of a
gallant fight ; two bullet wounds had passed through his leg near the upper thew
of the thigh. The hospitals were crowd­ed with wounded, and although he got as
much `care as possible,<sup>'</sup> still he was not so well cared as, ` under
other circumstances he would be ;' and the muscles of his leg sloughed away,
until, he said, when the wound healed, &quot; the skin alone covered the
bone.&quot; And so, truly, it was; from his thigh to about ten inches above the
knee there was only the bone covered with thin and seamed skin. There was one
topic more upon which I started, and that was the most import-ant topic—death
was near him. I shall not tell how I neared that great subject, but well I
remember his reply. ` There is a little book,' he said, ` which has taught me
much, and one thing it has taught me beyond all ; the longest life is not the
best life. You read,' he said, ` the Imitation of Christ,' An hour</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" align="center" style="text-align:center"><b>COLONEL THOMAS
FRANCIS BOURKE. 161</b></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">goes by very fast in the cell of a man whose hours are
numbered by the law, and my hour with Thomas<b> </b>Bourke fleeted faster than I
dreamed. Much he spoke,<sub>,</sub> and much I learned from others of him, but
all he said only fixed the picture I drew of him deeper in my mind, that a
better and nobler soul never existed upon the earth.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&quot;They have spread reports of his bearing and treatment
since his imprisonment, which are neither respectable fiction nor stray fact. It
has been asserted that he has left a wife and family in New York ; that he has
been allowed every delicacy which he required, and nothing has been refused to
him ; that the Sisters of Charity were in constant attendance upon him—and to
all those <i>assertions I give a fiat contradiction. </i>Thomas Bourke never was
married, he has no wife, no children. He leaves behind him in America a dear and
venerable mother, and as dear sisters, and of all of whom he was the prop and
stay. When he was convicted and sentenced he was placed upon the diet which the
law allows, and no more, and that diet is <i>but bread and water. </i>Afterwards,
he received the diet of the ordinary prisoners, and no other delicacy. The
Sisters of Charity never were in attendance upon him ; but the Sisters of Mercy,
from Goldenbridge, visited him upon one of the last days of his stay at
Kilmainham, and I believe did so at the request of the Very Rev. Mr. Kennedy,
the chaplain of the jail. Now, little as all those items in the strange eventful
history of General Thomas Bourke may seem, there is a necessity that there
should be no mistake about</p>

his gentleness, and his unobtrusive courage impressed all around him with a high
idea of his character, I have given to public record much, though not all, of
what I learned in an hour in the jail and cell of Thomas Bourke when he lay
there condemned to die.&quot; Subsequently the sentence of death was commuted to<b>
